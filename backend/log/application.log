As a provider, you are able to customize this experience for your clients, as well as view, comment, and react to client entries as part of providing longitudinal engagement with your clients to augment care.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t <span style=\"background-color: initial;\"><br>\n\t </span></p><p>\n\t With <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/103-tracking-metrics-and-adding-custom-metrics\" target=\"_blank\">Healthie’s Metric feature</a>, you can monitor and graph metrics like weight, height, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html\">BMI</a>, or <a href=\"http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2499472/relationship-among-body-fat-percentage-body-mass-index-all-cause\">body fat percentages</a> as well as create&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: initial;\">custom</em>&nbsp;metrics to track for each client. Also, Healthie Metrics can be viewed and tracked from both desktop and mobile devices, for convenient logging. Healthie's metrics platform syncs with devices and platforms like <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/187-fitbit-and-healthie\">Fitbit</a>, <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/442-apple-health-and-healthie\">Apple Health</a>, <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/523-google-fit-and-healthie\">GoogleFit</a>, and <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/441-devices-and-healthie\">iHealth</a> scales&nbsp;to automatically pull in client information for your review.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t You are able to adjust client journal entries and metrics tracked (Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Journal Entries</strong>). You can adjust important settings for your clients, so that they can see (or not see) certain features, and receive (or not receive) notifications. These settings can be adjusted on a global, group, and individual level. Learn more about customizing client settings <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/402-entries-settings-global-group-and-client\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t We also <span style=\"background-color: initial;\">suggest adding yourself as a test client or adding a family member/friend so that you can gain first-hand knowledge of the client logging and metrics tracking experience.&nbsp;</span></p><hr id=\"horizontalrule\"><h2>3. Launch a telehealth session</h2><p>\n\t <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/325-zoom-video-walkthrough\">Launch a telehealth session</a> for your client(s). Healthie's HIPAA-compliant video call (telehealth) solution enables you to conduct both&nbsp;one-on-one&nbsp;and&nbsp;group&nbsp;virtual sessions. With Healthie's Video Call system, you can host video call sessions, conduct webinars and classes, record sessions, and hold meetings with multiple participants.&nbsp;</p><hr><h2>4. Share documents with clients&nbsp;</h2><p>\n\t Healthie's <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/36-overview-healthie-documents-platform\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Documents</a> database is your repository of PDFs, Word Documents, Powerpoints, Ebooks, Images and even videos (mp4s) that you'd like to store internally, and share with your clients electronically. Documents can also be easily shared among all practitioners in your organization, as a main client resources hub as well as directly share these resources with your clients.&nbsp;You are able to create folders to organize the documents that you upload.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/5e8dff7b2c7d3a7e9aea9c15/file-bhN7sbNWhP.png\" style=\"font-weight: 700;\"></p><hr><h2>5. Chat with your clients</h2>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t Healthie's chat feature enables you to securely message and communicate with your clients, from within the web platform, and through the mobile apps.&nbsp;With Healthie's chat feature, you can message your clients one-on-one, create group chats, send message blasts, and even message other wellness providers in your organization. This is a powerful way to stay engaged with clients in between sessions, as well as securely discuss health information. Many providers also use the Chat platform to discuss appointment logistics, as it is often faster than e-mail and/or phone conversations back and forth.&nbsp;\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t <strong>There are four types of Chat available in Healthie:</strong>\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t <strong>1. One-on-one chat with a client: </strong>You are able to create one-on-one conversations with clients to communicate with them in between sessions. <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/82-overview-chatting-with-a-client\" target=\"_blank\">Here are instructions</a> to create a chat conversation with one of your clients.&nbsp;\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t <b style=\"background-color: initial;\">2. Community chats:&nbsp;</b>Healthie allows you to set up <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/84-group-conversations\" target=\"_blank\">community chats (group conversations)</a> for clients - these may be clients within a group, program you are offering, or as a general specialty need (e.g., similar health goals). Many wellness providers offer access to an exclusive Community Chat as a value-add service. Community Chats can be used in a more secure way to engage with a group of clients, versus using a social platform.&nbsp;\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t In a community chat, clients can share text, photos, and documents with each other. This is helpful to hold groups of clients, or families, accountable together.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t Clients will be able to see each others' initials, but clients will not be able to view each other's profile or any other information. Please make sure clients have signed appropriate waivers &amp; notices with regards to HIPAA and protection of client&nbsp;names before creating a group conversation. Providers must be the one to initiate a community chat, and must be in a community chat, as for security and privacy, clients cannot initiate a conversation privately.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t <strong>3. Message Blasts:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/85-message-blast\">Message Blasts</a> allow you to send individual chat messages to multiple clients at once. Clients do not know that you are sending this message to multiple clients,&nbsp;and clients will not see each other's names, e-mail, and other personal information.&nbsp;\n\t</p>\n</div><div>\n  To the clients it seems like a personalized message, meaning they don’t see you have sent the same message to other clients. Think of it as a \"bcc\" in an email thread.&nbsp;\n</div><div>\n  There are many possible ways in which you can leverage the Message Blast feature within Healthie, in order to communicate effectively with clients. Here are three ways you can use Message Blasts:\n</div><ul>\n\t\n<li>Offer a promotion, for a particular package, and send a message blast to clients letting them know.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li>Notify clients of updates to your availability that may be different from your standard offerings.</li>\t\n<li>Check-in on your clients (en masse) to see how they are doing, and if you can be helpful in providing them accountability in any way.</li></ul><p>\n\t <strong>4. Internal Group Conversations:</strong>&nbsp;If you are part of a team that uses Healthie, you can set up <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/168-create-an-internal-group-chat-for-members-of-your-organization\">internal group conversations</a> in order to communicate internally with other providers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"Section7\"></p><hr><h2>6. Set up your Goals platform to hold clients accountable</h2><p>\n\t One way to promote client&nbsp;engagement, and success, is by collaborating with clients to create realistic, and achievable wellness goals. Setting wellness goals with your clients provides them with the&nbsp; <em style=\"font-weight: normal; background-color: initial; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit;\">actions t</em>hey need to take, and the direction they need to move in.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/98-healthie-overview-goals-platform\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit;\">Healthie's Goals platform</a> makes it easy to set individual goals for clients, while also saving goals as favorites to re-use across clients. You are able to track your client's progress by <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/98-healthie-overview-goals-platform\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit;\">setting goals</a> for your client to \"check-off\" and monitor streaks to keep clients motivated over a long period of working with you.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t We recommend using this feature, which clients can access on a regular basis from their web and mobile portals, to accomplish their goals over a period of time working with you.&nbsp;</p><hr><h2>7. Build a program for clients to complete online</h2><p>\n\t Healthie's <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/143-getting-started-education-platform\" target=\"_blank\">Programs Feature</a> enables you to automatically distribute pre-loaded content to clients over a cadence of time. Content may include&nbsp;videos, quizzes, handouts, and surveys (with scoring capabilities).&nbsp;This tool is highly customizable to meet your particular workflow needs and can be used for delivering content, distributing e-mails and videos, and overall, building long-term relationships with your clients.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t Importantly, the programs feature within Healthie enables your clients to access materials within their client portal, and also discover and enroll in programs that may be a fit for their health and wellness needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t Programs are an incredibly powerful way to automatically drip-out content over a period of time, and provide ongoing engagement in a way that scales. Here are some common ways that Programs are used:&nbsp;</p><ul>\n\t\n<li>Run a 12-week online group on a particular topic</li>\t\n<li>Distribute content as part of a corporate wellness offering</li>\t\n<li>Provide reference material</li>\t\n<li>Create bonus material for packages</li>\t\n<li>Create an online course for sale&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li>Distribute feedback surveys&nbsp;</li></ul><hr><h2>8. Add your clients to Healthie&nbsp;</h2><p>\n\t There are a few ways that clients get added to your Healthie account. You can manually add a client, or they can be added automatically when they purchase a package or book an appointment with you from a <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/304-how-to-share-a-package\">link you have shared</a>;&nbsp;if a client is added through a package or appointment booking, you will receive a <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/89-adjust-your-notifications-settings\">notification</a> letting you know.</p><p>\n\t The most direct way is to manually add a client to Healthie within your Healthie platform:&nbsp;</p><ul>\n\t\n<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;Clients&nbsp;tab on your provider dashboard</li>\t\n<li>Click the&nbsp;\"Add Client\"&nbsp;button on the right-hand side&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li>Add your client's details. If you don't have this information, you can always collect it later and update their profile. However, you MUST enter a client's email address if you would like them to receive the invitation to join Healthie, email appointment reminders, and have access to your Intake Flow (any electronic paperwork you've created).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>\n\t Once you add a client to Healthie, they will receive an <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/88-overview-e-mails-to-clients\">invitation email</a> and are prompted to create a password to login to their Healthie Client Portal. Learn more about inviting clients to Healthie <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/160-overview-inviting-a-client-to-healthie\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t Clients&nbsp;can access their Healthie Client Portal from both the web browser and the <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/196-healthie-mobile-apps-for-ios-and-android\">mobile app</a>, available for iOS and Android. It's the same website login, and app, that you use as a provider, but clients will use their own email and password to log in.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/5e8e11cc2c7d3a7e9aea9d67/file-b8f605nt1t.png\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"></p><p>\n\t <strong>Need to import clients?</strong>&nbsp;If you have clients listed in a spreadsheet, or if you’d like to <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/41-import-data-from-another-platform\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-family: inherit;\">move clients over from another software system</a>, the&nbsp;Healthie&nbsp;team can help you.&nbsp;Email us at <a href=\"mailto:%7BWHITELABEL_INFO().branded_email%7D\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-family: inherit;\">hello@gethealthie.com</a> and include details about what you’d like to do.</p><p>\n\t No longer working with a client? <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;Once a client has been added to Healthie, they will continue to have access to their Healthie Client Portal indefinitely. If you are no longer working with a client and do not want to see updates on your Provider Feed (e.g., new journal entry posts), you can archive your client. Archiving does not delete any information, but it will prevent clients from messaging with you, booking a session, or making a purchase.&nbsp;</span>Learn more about archiving a client <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/159-archiving-and-unarchiving-clients\">here</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">.&nbsp;</span></p><hr><h2> Additional Resources</h2><h4>Live Classes</h4><p>\n\t To continue with account set up, we suggest that you join our <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/478-join-a-healthie-live-class\">Live Classes</a> to best learn the Healthie features and to set up your account along with our team.

Set up your discovery call or free consultation offer</h2><p>Many providers elect to offer a discovery call or free consultation session that can be used to assess fit for further work, with prospective clients. Healthie makes it easy for you to create your discovery call or free consultation, as well as help you generate a shareable link to promote the offering. This link can be added to your website, included in your email signature, and added to any other digital marketing material.\u{a0}</p><p>For example, you can add a link in your e-mail signature that links to a free consultation booking widget (instructions below).\u{a0}</p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/5ec55565042863474d1b152c/file-QWPd8TNL7b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; \" /></p><p><b>Step 1</b>: Create your free discovery call by following the steps in this <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/134-creating-a-free-consultation-as-an-appointment\" target=\"_blank\">guide to setting up a free consultation</a>.\u{a0}</p><p><b>Step 2</b>: Create a <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/157-overview-client-groups\" target=\"_blank\">Group</a> called &quot;Prospective Clients&quot; and a corresponding <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/44-creating-an-intake-flow-for-clients-to-complete\" target=\"_blank\">intake flow</a> within Healthie for these prospects, as you may prefer for these clients to complete different paperwork (or no paperwork). This will allow you to keep your contacts organized within Healthie, and customize the experience for clients at different stages of the customer journey.\u{a0}</p><p>Obtain the link to your calendar (or package) depending on how you created your discovery call. This link can be added to your website, included in your email signature, and added to any other digital marketing material. Be sure to have <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/341-setting-weekly-availability\">availability set</a> on your calendar, so that prospects are able to book with you.\u{a0}</p><p>When a prospect books a discovery call, or purchases your discovery call package, you’ll be notified. You can adjust your notifications within Healthie <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/89-adjust-your-notifications-settings\">here</a>.\u{a0}</p><p>For calls that are booked as a phone session, you will be required to call your client at the phone number they’ve provided. Their phone number will be visible in your calendar appointment details, and in your client’s profile.\u{a0}</p><p>For telehealth discovery calls, your client will receive an email after booking prompting them to create a Healthie account. They’ll need to log into their Healthie client portal from a web browser or the mobile app in order to launch your virtual session. No additional plugins or downloads are required.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>2. Customize notifications that you and clients receive</h2><p>The Healthie platform automatically sends you and your clients&#39; emails and push notifications to keep you updated on client activity, account activity, and business needs. E-mail notifications are sent to your e-mail address on file, and push notifications are sent through the mobile apps to notify you of updates and actions.\u{a0}</p><p>These <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/89-adjust-your-notifications-settings\" target=\"_blank\">notification preferences can be customized</a> to meet your specific business preferences. As you continue familiarizing yourself with the platform, we recommend running through notification options within your account, to ensure that they meet your expectations. If you work with a high volume of clients, we also recommend turning off some notifications, to focus on those that would be most actionable for your practice. Then, outside of notifications, you can incorporate into your workflow a review of journals and other features that you know you&#39;ll want to regularly review.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>3. Connect intake forms and charting templates with smart fields</h2><p>Healthie&#39;s intake form and charting template tools contain <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/490-smart-fields-for-connecting-intake-forms-and-charting-templates\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Fields</a>, which are\u{a0}auto-fill features that connect the intake form responses with Client Profile and Charting Template fields, to prevent providers from having to input the same piece of information more than once, into the portal. This saves providers and clients time collecting client information, and Smart Fields span client information, financial data, insurance information, and health fields.\u{a0}</p><p>We recommend reviewing the intake forms and charting templates that you have set up within Healthie, to look for places where <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/490-smart-fields-for-connecting-intake-forms-and-charting-templates\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Fields</a> can save you time.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>4. Set expectations with your clients</h2><p>As you introduce (or expand) the online suite of services that you offer to clients as part of working with them, it&#39;s important to set expectations around how you will leverage online features, and appropriately, draw boundaries around when and how you will respond to <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/100-tracking-clients-activity-on-website-and-mobile-apps\" target=\"_blank\">journal entries</a> and <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/82-overview-chatting-with-a-client\" target=\"_blank\">chat messages</a> received.\u{a0}</p><p>For example, you may want to communicate how often you plan to check journal entries and respond to chat messages, as well as offer these services as part of premium packages, versus being available to all.</p><p>Here are two ways to set expectations with your clients:</p><ol><li>Communicate these expectations as part of your office policies in your <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/139-creating-intake-forms-for-clients-to-complete-online\" target=\"_blank\">intake forms</a>, which clients can then <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/177-building-an-e-signature-form\" target=\"_blank\">e-sign</a> as part of their <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/44-creating-an-intake-flow-for-clients-to-complete\" target=\"_blank\">onboarding flow</a>.\u{a0}\u{a0}</li><li>Leverage the <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/460-chat-autoresponder-out-of-office\" target=\"_blank\">Chat Autoresponder</a> tool\u{a0}to help clients know when they can expect to receive a response to a Chat that they send.\u{a0}</li></ol><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>5. Identify how you will use Reports</h2><p><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/6-overview-of-healthie-reports\" target=\"_blank\">Healthie&#39;s Reports</a> makes it easy for you to pull information related to:</p><ul><li>Client information &amp; activity\u{a0}</li><li>Client metrics &amp; health outcomes</li><li>Appointment history and statuses (incl.\u{a0}no-show rates, most common appointment types, credits, etc)</li><li>Payment information (Bank transfers, Superbills, CMS 1500 data)</li><li>For organizations: understand individual and aggregate provider performance, track CMS 1500 claims and status by provider, organize accounting by provider\u{a0}</li></ul><p>These are invaluable for understanding how your business is performing, and observing key trends across business finances, operations, and outcomes. You can use these downloadable Reports to make decisions in your business, as well as market service efficacy to prospective clients.</p><p>We recommend taking a look at reports available to your business, and delving into which ones will be helpful for you.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Additional Resources</h2><h4>Live Classes</h4><p>To continue with account set up, we suggest that you join our <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/478-join-a-healthie-live-class\">Live Classes</a> to best learn the Healthie features and to set up your account along with our team.

Confirm Client Portal Access</h4><p>When a client purchases a package, books an appointment, or is manually added by a healthcare provider, they automatically have a Healthie Client account created for them. In most cases, clients receive an email, inviting them to log into their account by creating a password.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/160-overview-inviting-a-client-to-healthie#Section3\" target=\"_blank\">Overview: Inviting a Client to Healthie</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/156-what-happens-when-you-invite-a-client-to-healthie\" target=\"_blank\">What Happens When You Invite a Client to Healthie</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/161-resend-a-clients-welcome-e-mail\" target=\"_blank\">Resend a Client&#39;s Invite Email or Reset their Password</a></li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h4>2. Adjust the Appointment Status to Occurred\u{a0}</h4><p>From your Calendar, you can click on the appointment and adjust the status to &quot;Occurred.&quot; This can help with keeping accurate track of all of your appointments, and will tie into your Appointments Report.\u{a0}</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/531-view-calendar-and-appointments\" target=\"_blank\">View Calendar &amp; Appointments</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/312-deep-dive-appointments-report\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Dive: Appointments Report</a></li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h4>3. Review Intake Paperwork\u{a0}</h4><p>When you have your onboarding flows set up, typically providers will opt to have a flow of intake forms send to a new client, for electronic completion prior to their initial session. As part of your initial session, you may want to review these forms with your client, to ensure that have been completed. If there is a missing form, or incomplete forms, providers have the option to skip or complete this form during the session.\u{a0}</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/102-viewing-client-intake-forms\" target=\"_blank\">View, Skip, and Complete Client Forms</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/44-creating-an-intake-flow-for-clients-to-complete\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started: Intake Flows</a></li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h4>4. Review Billing Items</h4><p>You may prefer to save billing discussions for the end of your session, but some providers like to discuss billing at the beginning of an initial session, to avoid any misunderstanding. You can collect clients payment information, photo id card (ie. drivers&#39;s license) and insurance information in advance along with their intake forms. Clients can also electronically sign waivers (ie. Financial Agreements) in advance. You can review that all required documents are completed, and financial terms understood.\u{a0}</p><p>Payment can also be collected at the time of service if preferred.\u{a0}\u{a0}</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/560-onboarding-clients-paying-with-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">Onboard Clients Paying with Insurance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/514-collecting-billing-information\" target=\"_blank\">Collect Billing Information</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/673-photo-id-form\" target=\"_blank\">Photo ID Form</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/195-charging-a-client-or-requesting-payment\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started: Payments</a></li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h4>5.

This subscription allows multi-provider organizations to share resources, collaborate across clients, and maintain custom permissions surrounding core business needs. For more information on the Group Plan, please view the documentation <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/788-getting-started-with-group-plan\">here.</a></p><p>With the Group Plan you have the ability to have multiple providers under one account, as well as give access to non-providers (support staff, administrative staff, etc.). Later in this guide we will review the specifics of each type of “seat” in Healthie and the various permissions options.\u{a0}</p><br><h3>Data Migration</h3><p>If you are new to Healthie, you may want to consider importing patient information from your previous system into Healthie. Healthie’s goal is to support your overall migration process and we know data is a critical piece of it. Please review our documentation on how to request data to be imported into your Healthie account <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/41-import-data-from-another-platform\">here</a>.\u{a0}</p><p>While we do recommend requesting the import as early as possible, it’s important to set up a number of workflows in Healthie prior to the client data being imported. Specifically, you should make sure to set up provider accounts, client groups and settings, as well as your forms and intake flows.\u{a0}</p><br><h3>Appointment Settings</h3><p>The &#39;Appointments&#39; page serves as the central hub for establishing appointment settings that apply to all members of your organization. These settings not only streamline your administrative tasks but also significantly shape the client experience during the appointment booking process.\u{a0}</p><p>We recommend reviewing your appointment settings prior to adding in all your providers and clients into Healthie so that you are ready for appointments to be booked according to your schedule with appropriate buffer times, reminders for clients, and payment structure for appointments (if applicable).\u{a0}</p><p>To access the appointment settings page clicking on your <b>Calendar tab &gt; More &gt; Appointment </b>settings.\u{a0}</p><br><p>Recommendations for Appointment Settings\u{a0}</p><p>Under <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/118-deep-dive-appointment-settings#Section4\">Appointment Timing</a> you will be able to establish your appointment intervals, enable or disable same day appointments, and indicate how far out your clients can see your availability and book with you.\u{a0}</p><p><img  src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/749BKZTq7lTy4eGa4aeY8ESbaiOJdKmqUnweenw_Gn2DGpj5Gc1zIPUab3dn7WNgKpK1uY4mcv43FCntrfTvYssXsrqHAdvn8RaGBdortt24ohMgFyDH7GWXqbFVvlYZDdExVuCg_p9_iwlM85G7dnw\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%; \" /></p><p>Under <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/118-deep-dive-appointment-settings#Section7\">Payments and Credits</a>\u{a0} you can set up pricing for your services and enable the option to automatically charge and send invoiced after a service has been marked as occurred.\u{a0}</p><p><img  src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4CTd0BZ8TMiypJJK7XJQi04F7-_mnMbwVdHsk-62uqc5_j-q9zUSXUwp-DKQIxAMUzKr2MQOwHwW0hkQpQIJaGqbmZymHdHGa2jt8-iC_YA-BL4jSNE_9iPEUN-5lBMT-1qe1-MwmOpy7ByXPMDdrDc\" style=\"width: 740px; max-width: 100%; \" /></p><p>Under <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/1052-video-call-settings\">Video Call Settings</a> you can enable the preferred way you and your team wish to conduct your telehealth visits with your clients.\u{a0}</p><br><p>Additional resources for Appointment Settings</p><ol><li>A more in-depth walkthrough of appointment settings can be found <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/118-deep-dive-appointment-settings#Section1\">here</a>.\u{a0}</li><li>Additional Zoom features that can be activated for your account can be found <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/843-zoom-enable-additional-features\">here</a>.\u{a0}</li><li>Join our Part 1 Getting Started Class for a live walkthrough to set up your account including a breakdown of the Appointments Settings.

This versatile feature enhances flexibility and facilitates comprehensive client care coordination</p><br><p>Assigning Clients to Providers</p><p>When clients are booking for the first time through a calendar link or a package displaying availability among multiple providers, the client will have the option to select a provider OR Healthie will automatically assign that client to a provider if “no preference” is selected by the client. In cases where the calendar link only displays one provider&#39;s availability, the client will be assigned to that specific provider.

Once providers log into their accounts, they&#39;ll find the task displayed on their dashboard. Upon task completion, providers can mark it as done, causing it to be moved to the completed section of their dashboard. This approach promotes efficient task management and clear communication within the team.</p><br><p>Best Practices for Tasks\u{a0}</p><p>We recommend utilizing tasks for providers who have limited time availability, such as MDs who primarily need to co-sign and review charting notes or Billers who need to bill insurance. Implementing a team workflow that encourages team members to create tasks on their patients who need a co-signature or bill to create a task and assign it to the appropriate person. This ensures that as soon as the team member logs in, their tasks are ready, contributing to efficient task management and workflow optimization.</p><p>Healthie provides a <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/946-smart-tasks-for-organizations\">Smart Tasks</a> feature that automatically generates tasks when an appointment is marked as having taken place.

Healthie&#39;s average response time overall is around 300-500 ms. This response time can vary a lot based on the type of query you are making, and what you are including in your query. Healthie processes over a billion requests a month so a specific API user should not expect response times to change with load.</p><br><h3>How does the API handle large volumes of concurrent requests?</h3><p>Healthie handles large volumes of concurrent requests daily - 400 million API calls per month.

Healthie generates a unique, branded URL that you can place on your website, social media, and/or email newsletter for clients to log in to their account.</p><section class=\"callout-blue\"><h4>IN THIS ARTICLE:</h4><ul>\n\t\n<li><a href=\"#Section1\">Set up your Client Portal Login</a></li>\t\n<li><a href=\"#Section2\">Healthie's Non-Branded URL</a></li>\t\n<li><a href=\"#Section3\">Mobile App Links</a></li></ul></section><hr><p id=\"Section1\"></p><h2>Set up your Client Portal Login</h2><p>\n\t<strong>Part 1:</strong> Create and edit your Client Portal URL</p><p>\n\tTo create the custom link to your Client Portal:</p><ol>\n\t\n<li>Navigate to your Settings menu, by clicking the gear icon on the top right.</li>\t\n<li>Scroll to the “Business” menu, click on the “Branding” tab.</li>\t\n<li>Click \"Edit\" next to the \"Client Portal\" menu.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li>You can then customize your URL with your brand name (example: /LiveBetter)&nbsp;</li></ol><p>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/6140d3996c65aa15b87da1d9/file-ZrSpMeOgEB.png\"></p><p>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/6140d3a46c65aa15b87da1da/file-5LZ6KtoxKY.png\"><b style=\"background-color: initial;\">Note:</b> Your URL must contain 3-100 letters or numbers.

Something like the following layout would help ensure the patients' information can be readily imported.

This may include:</p><ul><li>You are seeking to run business analyses for your internal use</li><li>You are submitting information for an insurance billing audit</li><li>You are looking for a backup of your business and client records</li><li>You will be canceling your Healthie subscription</li><li>You are creating <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/901-create-a-second-healthie-provider-account\" target=\"_blank\">another Healthie provider account</a>, and would like to transfer client data Note: While Healthie can help with importing data from one account to another (that the account owner provides), we aren&#39;t able to conduct a true data transfer behind the scenes.\u{a0}</li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2><strong>Ways to Export Data from Healthie</strong></h2><p>Healthie makes it easy to pull business and client information from the system. Here is information that can be downloaded from the system:</p><h4>1. Leverage Healthie Reports</h4><p>Pull key business and client information by generating valuable reports in your <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/6-overview-of-healthie-reports\" target=\"_blank\">Reporting tab</a>. Particularly, you may want to <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/906-deep-dive-client-list-report\" target=\"_blank\">export the Client List report,</a> which is your list of clients and relevant client information. This report can be <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/41-import-data-from-another-platform\" target=\"_blank\">imported into another Healthie account</a> if your are transitioning accounts.\u{a0}</p><h4><strong>2. </strong>Download Client Chart Notes or Documents</h4><p>You can <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/184-generate-a-pdf-of-an-intake-form-charting-note\" target=\"_blank\">download existing documents or charting notes from your current account</a> for individual clients. </p><h4><strong>3. Download Intake Form and Charting Templates</strong></h4><p>You can download PDFs of Forms that you have created <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/184-generate-a-pdf-of-an-intake-form-charting-note\">following these instructions</a>.\u{a0}</p><p>Have a form you&#39;d like to migrate to another Healthie provider account? <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/430-sharing-forms-with-colleagues\">Share your form</a> with your new provider account email address. Once shared, the forms will be visible to you in your forms library. Editing these forms in your new account will not affect the original form from your first account.\u{a0}</p><h4><strong>4. Request a File Data Export</strong></h4><p>If you would like assistance with downloading all of your clients charting notes and documents, you can request an export here: <a href=\"https://healthieteam.typeform.com/to/VyKN7WCz\">File Data Export Request</a>. Please note that our standard export only includes client charting notes and documents as a Zip file, which will be placed in your Healthie profile under “Documents” for you to access. This process does take time so if you need data immediately, we recommend using reports or downloading client files per the instructions above.\u{a0}</p><br><p>Note: Only Healthie account owners can request and receive an export.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Download a Summary of Your Client&#39;s Logged Entries</h2><p>If you&#39;d like to download (and share) a complete record of your client&#39;s logged journal entries, you have the option to do so within charting.\u{a0}</p><p>Navigate to\u{a0}<strong>Client &gt; Charting &gt; Download Client Summary</strong></p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/5ea89500042863474d19ca3a/file-fMPcLqoSqB.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%; \" /></p><p>A PDF will populate in a new browser tab for you to download and save to your local device as needed.\u{a0}</p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/63c20ffee0d50f5555840abe/file-ewe2w3nC9z.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%; \" /></p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2><strong>Notes &amp; FAQs</strong></h2><ul><li>Follow the steps outlined here to\u{a0}<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/41-import-data-from-another-platform\">import client data</a>\u{a0}into your Healthie provider account (ie. if you are creating a second Healthie provider account).\u{a0}</li><li>For any export we create of client lists, that request will need to come from the assigned provider (or account admin) to ensure complete transparency every step of the way.</li><li>We do not currently support exporting credit card details. </li><li>We do not currently support transferring clients across\u{a0}<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/901-create-a-second-healthie-provider-account\">multiple Healthie accounts</a>\u{a0}that you may have.

We have observed that many of these documentation errors are caused by simple typos from manually typing in the <b>Date</b> field (e.g. 8/29/2023 is documented as 8/29/2024). </p><p><b>Learn more about creating and modifying Charting Templates </b><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/183-charting-templates-available-on-healthie\" target=\"_blank\"><b>here</b></a><b>.</b></p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/6542882a260b8506bdffd15b/file-GDPvRop7wE.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%; \" /></p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/654288d6f269a3172d8f38ae/file-FIDmyaDivi.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%; \" /></p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2 id=\"Option-to-Schedule-a-Message-for-Organization-Member-Chat--G-DnW\">Option to Schedule a Message for Organization Member Chat </h2><p>There may be times in which you&#39;d like to schedule a\u{a0}chat message to be delivered at a specified time in the future, and draft it in advance of that time.

Even having as few as one or two wellness professionals referring clients to you on a regular basis contributes to keeping your client-load full. Spending the time to build, grow, and nurture your client referral network is well worth the payoff.</p><p>\n\tAdditionally, working collaboratively with other providers offers clients an exceptional multi-disciplinary team consisting of healthcare professionals who have the knowledge, expertise, and all of the strengths such as dedication and a hard-working mentality necessary to work together effectively in making decisions for their clients.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tHealthie has a variety of features in place to support you as you build your referral network. Run through our checklist to be sure you’re leveraging the features available and to read our best practices for building your referral network using Healthie.</p><section class=\"callout-blue\"><h4>IN THIS ARTICLE:</h4><ul>\n\t\n<li><a href=\"#Section1\">Intake Forms</a></li>\t\n<li><a href=\"#Section2\">Referring Providers Feature</a></li>\t\n<li><a href=\"#Section3\">Efax</a></li>\t\n<li><a href=\"#Section4\">Sharing Healthie Resources with Other Providers</a></li></ul></section><hr><p id=\"Section1\"></p><h2>Intake Forms</h2><p>\n\tThe easiest way to collect a referring provider’s information is to include a space within your intake forms for a client to put down this information. Some clients will not have been referred by a provider, but as you build your referral network, you may find that the number of referred clients increases significantly. Including a place for clients to write down their primary physician’s or otherwise referring provider’s information allows you to gain a new contact, add that information to your client’s profile, and begin to build a relationship with that provider.</p><p>\n\tRead more about building intake forms \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/139-creating-intake-forms-for-clients-to-complete-online\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p id=\"Section2\"></p><h2>Referring Providers Feature</h2><p>\n\tHealthie’s Referring Providers feature makes it easy for providers and organizations to keep track of the healthcare professionals that they are in communication with. Diligently keeping track of your referral network will allow you to maintain important client communication, as well as continue to nurture your network to receive ongoing referrals.</p><h3>Build your Referral List</h3><p>\n\tThis feature allows you to maintain a master list of referring providers independent of their relation to a particular client. Moreover, you can quickly view your top referring providers.</p><p>\n\tYou are able to save and sort by a provider’s Name, Business Name, Specialty, City, and number of Clients Referred. In addition, you can view and edit specific details about this referring provider. Referring providers will only have access to the specific records that you share via \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/20-overview-of-healthie-e-faxing\">E-Fax</a>. These providers will not have a Healthie account login through your account membership.</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/6123f9f1b55c2b04bf6e0dd5/file-wyWTZxEcSf.png\"></p><p>\n\tAdd or remove a referring provider</p><p>\n\tWithin your list of Referring providers, you can add New Referring Providers, and choose to associate existing clients with this provider. You will be prompted to add their basic information, contact information, clients you’d like to associate with this provider, and any notes that you’d like to save. Notes are not viewable by the Provider or by your clients but can be used as an internal reference for you and your team.</p><p>\n\tTo add a new Referring Provider, navigate to the Gear Icon and click on “Settings.”&nbsp; On the left-hand side panel, click on the “Referring Providers” tab under Business.&nbsp; From here, you can click on the blue “Add New Referring Provider” button. &nbsp; A side panel drawer will slide out, prompting you to complete information on the referring provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/6123fa11f886c9486f8db586/file-uhLJ8UkkEW.png\"></p><h3>Add a referring provider within a client’s profile</h3><p>\n\tYou may find it easier for your workflow to add a new referring provider directly through your client’s profile. You are able to have multiple referring providers on file for a single client, as well as remove the association of a referring provider with a specific client. If a provider’s information is associated with a particular client, then the Referring Provider information will pre-populate into CMS 1500 and other forms in the platform, as well as within the Client’s Profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tTo add a referring provider through a client’s profile, go to the “Clients” tab on your dashboard and select your client. Click the “Actions” tab, and under “Client Info” click the “Referring Providers” button.&nbsp; Click the “Add Referring Provider” button, and complete the necessary information.</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/6123fa4bb37d837a3d0e6341/file-tW3SRZUgYX.png\"></p><h3>Sort and manage your Referral List</h3><p>\n\tOnce added, you can “View Details” on the referring provider by clicking the action tab (three dots) next to their contact info on the list. This will quickly display the Referring Providers’ contact information, associated clients, and any notes that you have added.</p><p>\n\tOn the main Referral List display, you can sort your list by:</p><ul>\n\t\n<li>Referring Provider Name</li>\t\n<li>Referring Provider Business Name</li>\t\n<li>Specialty</li>\t\n<li>or City</li></ul><hr><h3>Import or export referral contacts</h3><p>\n\tYou may find the need to export your Referral List (ie. if you’d like to add referring contacts to a mailing list). &nbsp; To export referral contacts, navigate to the Gear Icon on the top-right of your dashboard, and click on Settings. From the left-hand side panel, select “Referring Providers” under Business, and click the “Export as Spreadsheet” button.</p><p>\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/6123facf6ffe270af2a9b571/file-ITVwMrP5vn.png\"></p><p>\n\tYou’ll see a green confirmation banner appear stating “Your spreadsheet is being generated, once it has been generated it will appear in the \n\t<a href=\"https://secure.gethealthie.com/folders/9511/search/newestfirst/\">Generated Reports</a> folder in “Documents.” You will be able to continue working within Healthie while the report is generated. This will generate a CSV file containing information on your referring providers within Healthie.</p><p>\n\tYou can easily import contacts into your Referral List by contacting the Healthie team. Send us an email to hello@gethealthie.com and our Support Team will assist you with the import.</p><hr><p id=\"Section3\"></p><h2>E-fax</h2><p>\n\tFaxing with other healthcare providers can be a powerful way to build \n\t<a href=\"https://www.gethealthie.com/blog/best-client-referral-sources\" target=\"_blank\">referral partnerships</a> – this could be with local physicians, therapists, fitness centers, and other nutritionists. Here are some best practices we have seen, when it comes to using <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/category/263-e-faxing\">e-faxing</a> to build business and drive growth.</p><h3>Have clients sign a medical release form</h3><p>\n\tIn order to be HIPAA-compliant, it’s important to obtain written consent from your client for each healthcare provider that you want to share information with. You (and the provider you’re communicating with) should both obtain a written consent form.</p><p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.gethealthie.com/guides/sample-client-forms-for-your-wellness-practice\" target=\"_blank\">Download a Sample Medical Release Form</a></p><h3>E-fax Chart Notes to other healthcare providers after a session</h3><p>\n\tNurture relationships with referral partners and maintain good communication. Not only is this best practice when it comes to providing the best possible care for your clients, but referral partners will appreciate your close communication and follow-up reports.</p><p>\n\tThis extends to chart notes, lab reports, and other documents in a client’s file. We recommend to \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/24-sending-a-document-or-chart-note-via-e-fax\">E-fax chart notes</a> within 48 hours of a client session.</p><h3>Publish your E-fax number, so that it is easy to find</h3><p>\n\tInclude your e-fax number on business cards and other promotional materials for your business. List your e-fax line on your website, so it’s easy for others to locate.&nbsp;</p><hr><p id=\"Section4\"></p><h2>Sharing Healthie Resources with Other Practitioners</h2><p>\n\tAside from E-fax, there are a number of other ways to share your resources with other healthcare providers to gain clients and expand your referral network.&nbsp;</p><h3>Share a Promo Code for A Specific Office</h3><p>\n\tOne way to gain clients from a referring provider is to give the provider a promo code to offer to any clients who may want to work with you. Promo codes are an extremely effective and popular marketing tool that allow providers to track client sources of referral and incentivize their services to potential clients.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tWith Healthie, you can offer promotional codes as both a percentage off or a dollar amount off, and customize the name and amount off of a package. Moreover, you can tailor a promo code to apply to some or all payments of a recurring package, and establish an expiration date in order to encourage time-sensitive sign ups for your services.&nbsp;</p><h3>Share a QR Code with Other Providers</h3><p>\n\tWith Healthie, you can obtain individual links for your packages, as well as calendar links for clients to book independently. While you certainly have the option of sharing this link with your referral network, an easier option is to generate a \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/669-create-a-qr-code-with-your-packages-and-sessions\">QR code</a> for this link that providers can share with their clients, post around their office, or place in brochures or on business cards.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tTo create your QR code, identify the URL in which you want to direct clients. Then, you can use a free QR code generator, including: \n\t<a href=\"https://www.qr-code-generator.com/\">QR Code Generator</a> and <a href=\"https://www.websiteplanet.com/webtools/free-qr-code-generator/\">QR Code Generator (and modifier)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Create a Phone or Video Call “Appointment Type” for Healthcare Providers&nbsp;</h3><p>\n\tConnect with other healthcare providers for referral &amp; partnership opportunities by creating a special \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/130-setting-appointment-types-and-enabling-disabling-clients-to-book\">appointment type</a> for a phone or video call. You can put a <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/427-use-healthies-calendar-widget-as-a-url#Section2\">unique booking link </a>on your website, social media pages, emails, and other marketing materials so that other healthcare providers can book time to speak with you directly.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tYou can also edit the Appointment Confirmation \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/88-overview-e-mails-to-clients#Section3\">email template</a> for this unique appointment type within Healthie, so that prior to the appointment, you can provide more information about you and your business to potential referral contacts.&nbsp;</p>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "5bd66c122c7d3a01757a819b", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:12:56.519561Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:12:56.519561Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("6123f949b37d837a3d0e633d") }

In Healthie, one credit equals one session, for a specific appointment type, that a client could book with you.

In the event that the same charting note is open for a client in multiple browser tabs, providers will now see a notification \"Newer Version Available.\"&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis notification will alert the provider to the fact that there is a newer version of the note elsewhere open, and to prompt the provider to either:&nbsp;\n</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Overwrite</strong> the newer version of the note (keep the changes you've just made)&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Discard</strong> the changes and maintain the newer version of the note (discard the changes you've just made)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tThis notification will help ensure that important charting data is not lost, or duplicated.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a best practice, we highly recommend using Healthie's internal charting tabs option when charting to ensure that a charting note is only open once.

SSO allows a user to log in once and access services that may otherwise be disparate sites.\u{a0}</p><p>Healthie supports single sign-on via OAuth. Healthie can serve as the OAuth client, and your platform would be the OAuth provider.\u{a0}This allows clients to sign into Healthie via the credentials from your platform, and not have to maintain two separate log-in details.\u{a0}</p><p><b>Note</b>: If your client is accessing Healthie from one of your <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/395-multiple-providers-creating-custom-links-embeds-for-client-to-book\" target=\"_blank\">website embeds</a> (e.g., of packages or session booking), they are not prompted to log into the platform, so SSO is not needed on these embeds.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Examples of when to leverage SSO with Healthie</h2><ul><li>Your organization has an internal software that has provider and/or client login credentials (e.g., a consumer-facing app)</li><li>You use <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/558-athenahealth-and-healthie\">Athenahealth</a> or another EMR platform alongside Healthie, and your patients already login to AthenaHealth (in this instance, we can set up SSO such that your patients and providers can use their AthenaHealth login credentials to log into Healthie)</li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Setting up SSO</h2><p>Here is information on our typical process for OAuth Integration:</p><div>\n  1) You act as the OAuth provider, and are able to expose a standard openid configuration (e.g \n\t<a href=\"https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\">https://yourdomain.com/.<wbr>well-known/openid-<wbr>configuration</a>). If you use Okta, here's more information on \n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/configure-okta-as-oauth2-identity-provider\">how to set up this configuration</a>.&nbsp;\n</div><div>\n  2) You add us an authorized OAuth client, and are able to provide us with a client ID and client secret, and allowlist our redirect URL (generally something like \n\t<a href=\"https://secure.gethealthie.com/sso/company_name_auth\">https://secure.<wbr>gethealthie.com/sso/company_<wbr>name_auth</a>)\n</div><p>3) It&#39;s normally helpful to provide us with sample credentials so that we can sign in and verify the connection.\u{a0}Please e-mail us: <a href=\"mailto:hello@gethealthie.com\" target=\"_blank\">hello@gethealthie.com</a>, to complete the SSO process.\u{a0}There is a 14 business day turnaround time for setting up SSO. </p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Adding on SSO with Existing Users</h2><p>To add on SSO to an existing account with existing users, we see two common options:\u{a0} </p><p>1) Match accounts by email (and potentially first/last name) the first time the user signs in via SSO. Once they do that the first time, those accounts are linked moving forward.</p><p>2) You provide us with a mapped list of users from your IDP including their UID in the IDP, and their associated account in Healthie. We pre-load in their SSO UID so that the accounts are already linked, and we don&#39;t need to match by email.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>SSO for Sub-orgs</h2><p>On a full web white-label, we can help you set up SSO for a specific sub-org. This is limited to one SSO for providers, and one SSO for clients, per sub-org.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>If you are interested in setting up SSO with your web white-label, please e-mail hello@gethealthie.com with the subject line &quot;SSO&quot; and we will help you get this set up.</p><p><em><strong>Note: We cannot guarantee SSO compatibility, but we will make our best effort to help you identify a plan to streamline logins for your providers and clients. In some instances, there may be an additional fee for SSO.\u{a0}</strong></em></p><br><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Leverage an SSO with other Applications (ie. Cloudfare)</h2><br><p>If you&#39;re able to expose an openID configuration, we&#39;d be able to set it up; here&#39;s how we handle SSO:</p><br><p>1) You act as the OAuth provider, and are normally able to expose a standard openid configuration (e.g\u{a0}<a href=\"https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\">https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/openid-configuration</a>). Here&#39;s information about how to set that up with Okta if you are using them -&gt;\u{a0}<a href=\"https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/configure-okta-as-oauth2-identity-provider\">https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/configure-okta-as-oauth2-identity-provider</a></p><br><p>2) You add us an authorized OAuth client, and are able to provide us with a client ID and client secret, and allowlist our redirect URL (generally something like\u{a0}<a href=\"https://app.gethealthie.com/sso/company_name_auth\">https://app.gethealthie.com/sso/company_name_auth</a>). It is best practice to give us two different OAuth clients, one for dev/staging, and one for production, as well as a test log-in for the dev/staging one.</p><br><p>3) Healthie will take it from there!</p>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "5bd66c122c7d3a01757a819b", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:12:57.224839Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:12:57.224840Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("6228b974af6f8700f6dad266") }

Being that these are potential clients, it’s important to be able to market to these leads within the platform, through message blasts, emails, documents, and discovery calls.&nbsp; Adding these leads to Healthie can help you track their journey from potential to paying client and assess the strength of your sales funnel.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t\n<li>Insurance Clients: Creating a group for your insurance clients can help you streamline all of your other workflows within Healthie, including intake flows, appointment types, and scheduling.

This way, you can easily send message updates to all participants, host group check-ins, share documents, and more. Clients can offer support to one another&nbsp;</li></ul><ul data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t\n<li>Age Range or Health Need Groups: Another way to make sure the right information is reaching the right clients is to group them by their demographics. For example, if you work with patients who span a large age range, it might be beneficial to divide them into groups based on age range to make sure each group has access to the correct appointment types, documents, package, programs, etc. Same goes for clients with similar health needs (i.e. diabetes, eating disorders, celiac disease, etc.); having them in the same group ensures each client receives the right intake flows, receives the correct message blasts,</li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section2\"></p><h2 data-children-count=\"0\">Onboarding Clients into Different Groups</h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t When leveraging client groups within Healthie, it’s important to make sure your account is set up to support these client groups across all platform features. Be sure to run through this checklist to make sure your Healthie account is ready to support all of your client groups:</p><ol data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t\n<li><strong>Create an intake flow for each group: </strong>An <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/1162-getting-started-intake-flows-v2\">intake flow</a> is a series of forms that new clients will be asked to complete and/or sign electronically via Healthie. Forms can be completed from both the web browser, or from a mobile device. When you have a specific intake flow triggered to send when you add a client to a group, you can be sure you’ve collected all of the necessary information based on that client’s health and demographics. Healthie’s intake forms can be customized using a variety of question banks, meaning you can build your forms exactly how you need.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Create a specific appointment type for each group: </strong>Based on the needs of each group, you may have different appointment types to accommodate the different services you provide. Clients will see the name of the appointment, so be sure you can distinguish appointments for each group while still remaining professional in the names. Read more on creating appointment types <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/130-setting-appointment-types-and-enabling-disabling-clients-to-book\">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Create a package for the group: </strong>Based on how you structure your client groups, you may want to have certain packages only available to certain groups. When you build your package, keep the demographics of the group in mind and be sure to make it visible only to the group(s) you built it for. Read more on how to build client packages <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/190-building-client-packages-to-charge-for-sessions\">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Customize your automatic emails:</strong> While currently in Healthie you cannot send custom emails to individual clients or groups of clients, you can customize your email templates that send after certain actions are triggered in Healthie. For each appointment type, you can create specific reminders and confirmations to go to clients, as well as custom emails for each program and package purchased. If you have client groups associated with individual appointments, programs, and packages, it is best practice to make sure these emails are customized to speak to the specific clients in each group.

As changing a client&#39;s group can potentially trigger new paperwork, you&#39;ll want to follow the steps below to avoid any unwanted requests. If the client has already completed specific forms in the past, they will not be prompted to complete those forms again.\u{a0}</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/159-archiving-and-unarchiving-clients\" target=\"_blank\">Archive all inactive clients</a>, which will remove them from their current group\u{a0}</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/44-creating-an-intake-flow-for-clients-to-complete\" target=\"_blank\">Review your intake flows</a>, and make sure the right groups are associated with the right intake flows.\u{a0}</li><li>Confirm your <strong>default intake flow,</strong> as any clients who are NOT in a group will automatically be assigned to that flow</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/157-overview-client-groups#Section6\" target=\"_blank\">Delete unwanted client groups</a>, before you delete the group you&#39;ll be asked to reassign the clients to a new group\u{a0}</li><li>Alternatively, you may want to manually <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/792-change-a-clients-group\" target=\"_blank\">move clients from one group to another</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/130-setting-appointment-types-and-enabling-disabling-clients-to-book\" target=\"_blank\">Review your appointment types</a> to confirm they are associated with the correct/new client groups\u{a0}</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/190-building-client-packages-to-charge-for-sessions\" target=\"_blank\">Review your client packages</a> to confirm they are associated with the correct/new client groups</li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section4\"></p><p>Best Practices for Engaging Client Groups</p><ol data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t\n<li><strong>Leverage the community chat feature:</strong> Adding clients to a group can be a strategic way to keep them accountable by adding an additional level of support. Within <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/84-group-conversations\">community chat</a>, clients can share text, photos, and documents with each other. As the provider, send weekly messages in the group chat to encourage participants to share progress, ask for advice, and support other group members along their health journey. Real-time support from their provider is a powerful motivator for clients; but, when clients can receive support from people in a similar position, they are increasingly likely to improve health outcomes and make positive progress.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Hold group check-in sessions: </strong>Building on the idea of leveraging client groups for added accountability and support, you can host group <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/325-zoom-video-walkthrough\">Zoom sessions</a> for your client group. Some clients may want the opportunity to talk with you and other group members face to face, to facilitate a relationship and receive advice in real-time. Within Healthie’s calendar, you can invite an entire group to a Zoom appointment, make the appointment recurring, and send follow-up forms after the appointment.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Build custom programs for each group: </strong>When building a program, similar to a package or appointment type, you can make it visible to only certain groups. Programs are a great way to engage clients between sessions, as you can have them complete educational modules, watch videos, download documents, and more. Tailor the content of the program based on the needs of the group. You can make the program an optional add-on to the services you already provide, or include it in your basic service package for the group. Learn more about building programs for clients <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/143-getting-started-education-platform\">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Change client groups as they progress: </strong>Depending on where your client is within their wellness journey, there may need to come a time when they will need to be placed in a new group. Be sure to monitor client progress closely, and change a client’s group once appropriate. If leveraging features such as group chat and Zoom appointments, having support from others at a similar stage as themselves is crucial; i.e. a client in a group they cannot relate to is not going to feel as motivated to succeed. While clients can only participate in one group at a time within Healthie, it is easy to <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/157-overview-client-groups#Section5\">change a client group </a>when the time comes.&nbsp;</li></ol>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "5bd66c122c7d3a01757a819b", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:12:58.286225Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:12:58.286226Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("6123dd2921ef206e5592de6b") }

You must also be 18 years of age or older to consent to a lab order. This restriction comes from the physician network that Healthie contracts with. Parents cannot consent on behalf of minors.&nbsp;Please do not purchase a lab order if you reside in one of these states, or are under 18 years of age.<strong> Lab orders are non-refundable.&nbsp;</strong></p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t<strong>Can I walk-in to a Quest site?&nbsp;</strong></p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t After you purchase your lab order, you will be prompted to schedule an appointment at a nearby Quest Lab site.

If you would like to extend this, please contact us at hello@gethealthie.com.</li><li>Healthie offers two-way syncing with Google calendar and Microsoft Outlook calendar and it is on our roadmap to add this capability for iCal.\u{a0} A two-way sync pushes Healthie appointments onto your personal calendar by creating a secondary calendar named &#39;Healthie&#39;, and pulls your existing events to override any weekly availability that you have set up, to prevent double booking.\u{a0}\u{a0}</li><li>All day events that may exist on your external calendars are NOT pulled into Healthie&#39;s calendar. If you&#39;d like an event to be pulled into Healthie&#39;s calendar, please make sure it is not marked as &quot;All Day.&quot;</li><li>Past appointments pulled into your Healthie calendar, from external calendars, are not saved on your Healthie Calendar, so you will not see these appear for past dates / times.\u{a0}</li><li>If you&#39;ll be out of office, we recommend putting a time block on your Healthie calendar to prevent clients from booking.

This means you&#39;ll see all of your Healthie appointments on your iCal.\u{a0}</p><p>In order to\u{a0}<u>pull</u>\u{a0}appointments from specific sub-calendars from iCal into Healthie, it&#39;d be necessary to setup a sync with Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar. With this setup, appointments from Healthie would be pushed to iCal, and appointments from iCal would be pushed to Google Calendar/Outlook Calendar, these appointments would then be pushed from Google Calendar/Outlook Calendar to Healthie. In short, this means that sub-calendar appointments will also sync inside Healthie, and prevent clients from booking appointments during those additional calendar events.\u{a0}</p><p>In order to set this up, after subscribing to your Healthie Calendar with a sub calendar in iCal:</p><ul><li>Connect your\u{a0}<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/146-sync-healthie-with-ical-google-and-outlook-calendars#Section4\">Google Calendar</a>\u{a0}with Healthie\u{a0}</li><li>In iCal, share the designated sub-calendar by making it public. If you are not the creator of that sub-calendar (ie. in the case with shared calendars) then you&#39;ll need to ask the creator to make it public.

Make sure that you've added the group session to your calendar&nbsp;</strong>\n</div><div>\n  For group sessions, you must manually schedule the event(s) on your calendar in order for clients to book. This is different from \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/341-setting-weekly-availability\" target=\"_blank\">setting availability</a> on your calendar, which opens your schedule for clients to book 1:1 sessions.

Check your calendar settings for \"Maximum days in advance\" and Contact types</strong></p><p>\n\t If clients aren't seeing your group session on the calendar, it's possible that they are prevented from booking sessions too far in advance (which includes group sessions). Review your calendar settings (Gear icon &gt; Settings &gt; Appointments).

This fee is standard across all credit cards (Amex, Discover, Visa, Mastercard). The platform integrates with Stripe, which is Level 1 PCI - compliant.\u{a0}</p><p>If a provider is set up to do banking in one country, and bills a client with banking in another country, then international Stripe fees will be collected &amp; added to the clients&#39; total fee.\u{a0}</p><ul><li>1% fee for international payment cards\u{a0}</li><li>1% fee if <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/currencies/conversions\" target=\"_blank\">currency conversion</a> is required</li></ul><p>When using Stripe via Healthie&#39;s direct integration, you&#39;ll receive a lower than normal Stripe rate.

Health Reimbursement Accounts and Flexible Spending Account cards can be treated just like credit cards through the billing platform. Stripe&#39;s standard processing fees of 2.9% + $0.30 will apply as normal.

In this case, clients will use their HSA to pay towards their deductible (out-of-pocket payment required before insurance starts covering \u{a0}healthcare expenses). On top of this, a client may add additional dollars to their HSA for more planned healthcare spending, to save on post-tax expenses.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Learn more about HSA/FSA payments through Healthie <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/908-hsa-and-fsa-card-payments\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Can the platform&#39;s payment processing be used internationally?\u{a0}</h2><p>Yes, payment processing can be used internationally within the following list of countries currently supported by Healthie: </p><ul><li>United States</li><li>Australia</li><li>Belgium</li><li>Canada</li><li>Czech Republic</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Finland</li><li>Germany</li><li>Greece</li><li>Ireland</li><li>Netherlands</li><li>New Zealand</li><li>Portugal</li><li>Singapore</li><li>Slovenia</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>United Kingdom</li></ul><p>If a provider is set up to do banking in one country, and bills a client with banking in another country, then international Stripe fees will be collected &amp; added to the clients&#39; total fee.\u{a0}</p><ul><li>1% fee for international payment cards\u{a0}</li><li>1% fee if <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/currencies/conversions\">currency conversion</a> is required</li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>How long does it take for a payment to show up in my bank account?</h2><p>Payments will appear in your bank account within 3-5 business days. You can find more information on receiving bank transfers <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/931-receiving-bank-transfers-from-healthie\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\u{a0}</p><p><em>Please note: bank holidays do not count as a business day.</em></p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>How will charges display on my client&#39;s credit card statement?\u{a0}</h2><p>Charges on your client&#39;s credit cards for payments made through Healthie will show up as your Brand Name. For example, if your Brand Name is &quot;My Business Name&quot; your client will see a charge for &quot;My Business Name&quot;</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Are my clients able to cancel a package?</h2><p>Clients are not able to cancel a package they have purchased from you on their own, they will need to contact you, and you can cancel their membership in a package. This allows you to be fully aware of clients who wish to cancel services and to enforce any cancellation policies you have in place.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2> What billing notifications will my client receive?\u{a0}</h2><p>Your client will receive an email notification when they make a payment (or when you request payment) through the Healthie platform. Additionally, they will be able to log into their client portal (from a web browser) and click on Billing &gt; Payments to see their history of transactions.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2> How are refunds managed?\u{a0}</h2><p>If you refund a client within the platform, the refund will post on the client&#39;s method of payment within 5-10 business days. Clients receive the full amount of the payment refunds. Please note that Healthie no longer covers processing fees when refunding payments - clients don&#39;t pay any processing fees; the processing fees will come out from the provider&#39;s side.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Does Stripe have a physical card swiper?\u{a0}</h2><p>No. Please enter card numbers manually, within a client&#39;s profile. Numbers are then stored securely within the system. Healthie is PCI compliant which means that there are\u{a0}security measures designed to ensure a secure environment for transmitted credit card information. You can read more about Healthie&#39;s security <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/69-healthie-security-and-privacy\">here</a>.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Do I manage a Stripe account separately?</h2><p>Our direct integration with Stripe eliminates the need for any 3rd party logins or payment processors -- you&#39;ll be able to accept payments and charge for services right from your Healthie account, and you do not need to manage a Stripe account separately. This also means that you are able to get set up with accepting payments immediately upon creating your Healthie account.</p><p>As part of our relationship with Stripe, you do not maintain a log in to Stripe, as Healthie handles that relationship on your behalf.</p><p>If you are interested in opening up a Stripe account for other uses in your business, we recommend reaching out to Stripe directly to get set up.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Will I receive an end of year report (1099-k) of payments for tax purposes?\u{a0}</h2><p>For those who require a 1099-K (processed more than $20,000 AND had more than 200 transactions), Healthie will automatically mail a 1099-K and e-file it with the IRS.</p><p>These are charges\u{a0}made in Healthie via our payment processor. Your 1099 via Healthie will not include CMS 1500 claims created/submitted, as well as payments / checks that you received from clients outside of the platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://support.stripe.com/questions/1099-k-forms-issued-by-stripe.

An accountant can further assist you in how to report your income.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>How do I charge a client for a package, if I don&#39;t see their name appear?</h2><p>You can directly charge a client for a package through the Healthie platform. Review this <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/195-charging-a-client-or-requesting-payment\">billing article</a> to ensure that you&#39;ve taken the right steps to charge a client. If you do not see a client&#39;s name appear from the drop-down, it is likely that your client does not have a credit card on file. Please go to their Profile &gt; Overview &gt; Billing and add a card number. You may want to consider making the &quot;Billing Info&quot; form a required step in your <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/44-creating-an-intake-flow-for-clients-to-complete\">intake flow</a> to ensure every client puts a credit card on file.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Can I connect Healthie with my Square account?</h2><p>At this time, Healthie cannot connect with your existing Square account.

We recommend creating a second Healthie account if a separate bank account is needed, or using our sub-organization feature available for <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/789-getting-started-with-enterprise-plan\" target=\"_blank\">Enterprise</a> plans. </p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>What is an EIN?</h2><p>When you set up payment processing in Healthie, you will need to enter your bank account information. The system requests things like your business EIN, social security number, address, etc.</p><p>An EIN is like a &quot;company social security number&quot; (compared to your individual social security number). If you are a sole proprietor, you may be okay entering your personal SSN, but when you create an LLC or Corporation, you will get an EIN number. If you have a corporate bank account you will want to get an EIN instead.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Are ACH / direct bank payments accepted through Healthie?\u{a0}</h2><p>Yes, <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/737-ach-payments\" target=\"_blank\">here is some information on accepting ACH payments</a> via Healthie.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Can I split up a client payment into two cards?</h2><p>Yes, You will need to take the following steps, if a client would like to pay on multiple cards:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/192-add-or-change-a-clients-credit-card-on-file\" target=\"_blank\">Enter the first method</a> of payment for a client</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/195-charging-a-client-or-requesting-payment\" target=\"_blank\">Charge client</a> for the amount that would like to be applied to first card</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/192-add-or-change-a-clients-credit-card-on-file\" target=\"_blank\">Update the payment method</a> on file for a client</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/195-charging-a-client-or-requesting-payment\">Charge client</a> for the amount that would like to be applied to second card</li></ul><p>You are able to store multiple cards on file for a client, and also indicate a default, and whether the card is HSA/FSA versus a personal card.\u{a0}\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2 id=\"What-is-the-minimum-fee-for-a-charge-via-Healthie--vk-6Y\">What is the minimum fee for a charge via Healthie?\u{a0}</h2><p>There may be instances in which you&#39;d like to have a small charge.

Information is pre-filled to save team member time from charting notes, patient information, and other relevant fields.</p><p>Note: You must be credentialed with insurance companies and considered to be in-network to submit claims. If you are not credentialed, we recommend that you create a<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/63-superbill-overview\">Superbill</a>, in which you receive payment for services from the client at the time of service, but clients can submit a Superbill for possible reimbursement.\u{a0}\u{a0}</p><p>Healthie&#39;s CMS 1500 feature contains safeguards as you fill out the form, to help ensure that you have completed all required fields. It is important to double-check that you have completed fields correctly prior to submission to an insurance company, in order to minimize the likelihood that a claim is denied. We recommend reviewing the <a href=\"http://www.nucc.org/images/stories/PDF/1500_claim_form_instruction_manual_2012_02-v6.pdf\">NUCC official instruction manual</a> and coordinating directly with your payer to understand best practices on Creating a Claim and Submitting this form for insurance reimbursement.</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t There are two ways to access a CMS 1500 Form Template within your Healthie account:</p><ol data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t<li>Navigate to <strong>Billing &gt; CMS 1500 &gt; New CMS 1500 &gt; Select Client</strong></li>\t<li>Within a Client Chart Note, <strong>Export to CMS 1500</strong></li></ol><p>This will generate the standard CMS 1500 form template that you will need to complete. If you have client information stored within Healthie, the form will pre-populate with information that is already on file, in order to save you time entering information.\u{a0}</p><p>Moreover, if you have previously created a CMS 1500 form for the client that you have selected, past information will pre-fill, so you will be able to leverage that information, and make modifications as necessary, to complete and submit your form.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section2\"></p><h2 data-children-count=\"0\">Completing fields of the CMS 1500 form</h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t You will be prompted to enter required fields of the CMS 1500 form prior to creation and submission of the Form. Once you have filled out an initial CMS-1500 form, basic information will populate into subsequent claims created in Healthie. Healthie's CMS 1500 form generator is broken into 6 sections.

Through the card (which may be a physical card, or simple a written card number), you must process the card as a \"payment\" into a payment processor. While Healthie utilizes Stripe as a payment processor, our direct integration means that our members do not need an account/login with Stripe. To process your payment card, many of our members either create their own Stripe or Paypal account, and process the payment accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t Once you've been issued reimbursement, we suggest that you review your claims and update any reimbursement details for reconciliation.

Not only can the provider who wrote the charting note do this, but also any other member of the provider’s Organization who can access the charting note.</p><p>As of now, the only way to prevent the editing of a signed charting note is to lock it, but this is not enough for organizations that have a co-signing protocol. When there is a co-signing protocol, multiple providers need to sign a charting note, and only the supervising provider is supposed to ‘lock’ the charting note (after they have reviewed and signed it).</p><p>The objective of this feature is to better support our more clinical customers, while maintaining the flexibility that currently exists for less clinical customers who do not wish to apply this kind of restriction.</p><p>Navigate to Settings &gt; Charting, and you will see a permission titled &quot;Freeze signed chart notes&quot; which is default turned OFF. </p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/65b2b678270765339befc5de/file-PYkypvRDH7.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 100%; \" /></p><br><h2 id=\"Additional-Resources-sLbxO\">Additional Resources</h2><p>Attend one of our weekly live classes for a deep-dive walkthrough of Healthie&#39;s EHR feature.

You still receive payment at time of service, but this may potentially reduce the net cost of care for your clients, as some insurance companies will cover a % of services from out-of-network providers, and/or apply services towards a client&#39;s deductible.

What this means, is that if you wanted to charge a client for a) a bundle of sessions and b) an ancillary package, you could charge for two services on one day, and it would show up as one consolidated line item on the client end.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"Section3\" data-children-count=\"0\"></p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><h2 data-children-count=\"0\"> <strong>What happens when a client payment fails? Do I need to re-try this charge?</strong></h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t Automatic payments should be manually re-tried, our payment processor does not retry any failed payments once the credit card is updated. If the client is on a recurring payment, future / upcoming payments will still charge as scheduled.

Payments can be manually resumed at any time, by revisiting the Payments tab and locating the payment, and selecting “Restart Automatic Payments.”</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/610169d564a230081ba19c09/file-GTMI9ZBl1N.png\"></p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t To fully cancel a recurring payment, navigate to the Payments tab once again, and select “Stop Payment” from the dropdown menu.&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></span></p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><h2 data-children-count=\"0\"> <strong>What is the ideal size of a picture for my client package?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t For best results with your package cover image, use an image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a minimum size of 480 pixels by 270 pixels.</p><p id=\"Section5\" data-children-count=\"0\"></p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><h2 data-children-count=\"0\"> <strong>Can I change the billing date of a package on Healthie?</strong></h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t There may be instances in which you'd like to change the date that a client is billed. We recommend cancelling the automatic payment, and then re-charging your client on the new date to re-enrolling them in a package. At this time, the concept of a \"trialing package\" does not exist in the platform, but we will update this when the platform supports this.&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t A future update in Healthie is planned to help improve the ability to change a package billing date. Please check back to this article for an update, or email our team at hello@gethealthie.com so you can be notified when this capability is live.&nbsp;</p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><p id=\"Section6\" data-children-count=\"0\"></p><h2 data-children-count=\"0\">Why can't my clients see my package(s)?&nbsp;</h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t Each Healthie package has a setting that allows you to make it \"visible\" or \"not visible\" to clients. This allows you to control which clients can see/purchase your packages.&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t Please review our Getting Started: Client Packages article &gt; \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/190-building-client-packages-to-charge-for-sessions#Section2\" target=\"_blank\">Included Items</a> section &gt; Client Settings &amp; Package Visibility</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t Additionally, packages are only viewable by clients via the web browser. Therefore, if a client is reporting they cannot see packages, they may be trying to view them from the mobile app. Redirect your clients to use the web browser to purchase any packages.&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t<strong>Note</strong>: If you've made a package visible, but your client cannot view, please make sure you have not included a program that has already ended. By default. packages containing past programs will not show.</p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><h2 data-children-count=\"0\">Can a client cancel recurring payments from their account?</h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t As of now, clients can't cancel on their own without reaching out to you.</p><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t We recommend adding some information in your intake flow or in the email templates, letting them know if they would like to cancel a service, they would have to reach out to you directly.</p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><p id=\"Section8\" data-children-count=\"0\"></p><h2 data-children-count=\"0\"><strong>Can I change the currency of a package within Healthie?</strong></h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t If you need to change the currency of a package or payment within Healthie, please reach out to us at hello@gethealthie.com and our team will make the change for you.&nbsp;</p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><h2 data-children-count=\"0\"> Can I limit the number of times a package is purchased per month?</h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t At this time, we don't have a feature to limit the number of clients to sign up for a package. We have an archive package feature, where once a certain number of clients signs up, you can achieve the package. Learn how to archive a package \n\t<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/191-edit-share-and-delete-existing-client-packages\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><p id=\"Section10\" data-children-count=\"0\"></p><h2 data-children-count=\"0\">Can I split a package payment into multiple payments?&nbsp;</h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t To split a package in multiple payments, set the package as a recurring payment, and set the number of billing periods as the number of payments you'd like the client to make. For example, if you'd like to split a package into two payments that a client pays across two months, set the billing frequency as \"Monthly\" with 2 billing periods occurring.</p><hr data-children-count=\"0\"><p id=\"Section11\" data-children-count=\"0\"></p><h2 data-children-count=\"0\">Can a client refund a package themselves?</h2><p data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t No, you will have to manually refund the client for a package or payment. Be aware that sometimes clients will go around you to their bank to request a refund; be sure to communicate with your clients in this case, as Healthie is not able to track when this happens.</p><hr><p id=\"Section12\"></p><h2>Why can't my client see or buy packages from the mobile app?&nbsp;</h2><p>\n\tPackages are only viewable by clients via the web browser. Therefore, if a client is reporting they cannot see packages, they may be trying to view them from the mobile app. Redirect your clients to use the web browser to purchase any packages.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tCurrently, in-app purchasing is not supported in Healthie. There are additional fees that are associated with in-app purchasing, and these fees can be very high for healthcare classified applications. At this time, the additional fees that would be passed on to providers and clients, will unfortunately make in-app purchasing costly. In the interim, clients are able to log into their Healthie account from the web browser (versus the app) to view and purchase packages, or make invoice payments.&nbsp;</p>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "5bd7a8c104286356f0a533b8", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:26.917343Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:26.917344Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("5bd65e932c7d3a01757a814f") }

The Reorder function can be used when a prescriber would like to &quot;Reorder&quot; the same medication for a patient. The prescription will automatically be entered into the &quot;Patient&#39;s New Prescriptions (to be approved)&quot; and the prescriber simply needs to click on the check box and then click &quot;Approve &amp; Send&quot; or &quot;Approve &amp; Print&quot;.</p><p><strong>Notifications for Refills</strong></p><p>We currently have provider notifications for refill requests; this occurs when a patient runs out of medication and asks the pharmacy for a refill when there are none left on the original prescription. The pharmacy then sends a refill request (renewal request) to the provider through DoseSpot. </p><p>We do have an update with our Spring Release for Prescribing Agents to handle refill requests. They can now handle Refill, RxChange, and Cancel requests through new endpoints which require the onBehalfOfUserId parameter. We don’t have a mechanism for notifications if a patient does not request a refill from the pharmacy.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2 id=\"How-can-I-reorder-a-medication-from-within-Healthie--S8eDN\">How can I reorder a medication from within Healthie? </h2><p>Prescriptions will need to be reordered from the <b>Client&#39;s Profile &gt;\u{a0}</b><strong>Add and Manage Prescriptions </strong>which will bring you to the E-Prescribing portal. </p><p>Below are two options for managing reorders: </p><p><b>1.

Information that will be requested from the provider includes a credit card, social security number, and driver&#39;s license.\u{a0}</p><p>This is part of Dosespot&#39;s identity verification process.\u{a0}This type of identity proofing is a common practice for detecting fraud and establishing the validity of the individual&#39;s identity. The prescriber’s credit card is run through Experian to verify that they are who they are and that their information matches up with the information on the credit card/report. The card is not charged nor is it kept on record. This is done for the prescriber’s protection from fraudulent activity. A soft inquiry is placed on the report and does not affect your credit score or your ability to borrow.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a workaround if the clinician does not have a credit history. This is a requirement from Experian who does the 3rd party identity verification step.

When Other is selected, a new field for &quot;Gender Identity&quot; will appear. You can free text your client&#39;s gender identify within this field.\u{a0}</p><p>Please note, there is a separate &quot;Sex on File for Insurance&quot; field, as insurance payers require a traditional selection on a CMS 1500 claim form. Clients will\u{a0}not\u{a0}see these gender fields or indicators.\u{a0}</p><p>A forthcoming update will enable gender/identity information to be captured through a &quot;Smart Field&quot; within Healthie, which can be added to forms (ie. Intake or Charting forms) and will automatically update your client&#39;s profile.\u{a0}</p><p>In the meantime, to add custom questions to your client&#39;s form, we suggest that you use the default/blank question fields. For example, if you&#39;d like to be more inclusive for gender, you can select a blank multiple choice or drop-down question from the default question bank. Edit the field, and add your gender identifier options. This is just one example of how you can build truly tailored forms for your clients.\u{a0}</p><p>At Healthie, we understand that diversity, inclusivity and sensitivity are critical factors in healthcare screening and care. For this reason, we continue to add items to our Product Roadmap that will help make default intake forms, and client-facing aspects of the Healthie portal, increasingly more inclusive.

Clients will set up an appointment at a nearby Quest Lab site in order to have their blood drawn. The lab order is sent directly from Healthie to Quest labs, so clients do not need to bring any paperwork with them to their appointment other than a valid photo id.\u{a0}</p><p>Client participants will be responsible for getting their specimen collected at the Quest Diagnostics location.\u{a0}They can present their lab order at any Quest Diagnostics location in the USA. The lab order is valid for 6 months from the date the lab order was gene rated. If they still wish to visit the lab after 6 months a renewal fee will be invoiced for $15 to acquire a new lab order plus any adjustments if the price of the test has increased in the past 6 months.</p><p><strong>Lab orders will be generated within 3-4 hours.

Once the package is created, &quot;Labs&quot; will appear in your main Healthie menu.

A package containing lab orders can be marked up for-profit, or include other services that can be charged at that time (ie. a follow-up consultation to discuss lab results).\u{a0}</p><p><strong>Once a package containing a lab order is purchases by a client, the lab order rate/fee is not refundable.\u{a0}</strong></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: when creating a subscription (recurring) package that includes labs, the lab order needs to be paid for in the FIRST payment. The system will not allow you to set the first payment at a rate lower than what the cost of the labs are. The labs will not renew for each subsequent payment. Labs will be ordered only one time. If you&#39;d like to reorder lab work for a client, please have them purchase the package again.\u{a0}\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section7\"></p><h2>Can I help a client refund an E-Lab?</h2><p>Unfortunately, once a lab has been purchased and ordered, even if the client no longer requires them and has not scheduled them, E-labs cannot be refunded.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Where can I see what is included with Quest Lab combos?</h2><p>Here is where you can see details of combination lab packages: <a href=\"https://www.labtestingapi.com/store\">https://www.labtestingapi.com/store</a></p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section8\"></p><h2>Can my client pay with their insurance?\u{a0}</h2><p>At this time, clients are required to pay for labs out of pocket, and labs purchased via Healthie are not processed via insurance.

Clients must also be 18 years of age or older to consent to a lab order. This restriction comes from the physician network that Healthie contracts with. Parents cannot consent on behalf of minors.\u{a0}\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section10\"></p><h2>Can my client walk-in to a Quest site?\u{a0}</h2><p>After your client purchases their lab order, they will be prompted to schedule an appointment at a nearby Quest Lab site. Quest labs do accept walk-ins but your client may have to wait longer.\u{a0}The scheduling tool via Healthie will display all contact information for the Quest site, include address, phone number, and hours.\u{a0}We suggest that your client call the Quest location near them directly to confirm if an appointment is required, especially as locations may be operating by appointment only due to COVID-19.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Do I need to provide my clients with any paperwork for lab ordering?\u{a0}</h2><p>No. Once your client purchases a lab order, they will be prompted to complete a Lab Order Consent Form directly within Healthie. You do not need to provide this form, it will appear automatically to the client.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section11\"></p><h2>How do I add a client&#39;s lab order to their chart in Healthie?</h2><p>Within the Labs tab, you&#39;ll be able to view a lab and download the requisition form as a PDF. You can then upload the PDF into your client&#39;s chart. You can also E-Fax this document to other members of your client&#39;s care team (with their consent). <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/185-store-and-share-a-document-with-client-phi-in-healthie\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a></p><p>You have the option to add a <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/509-custom-metrics-in-healthie\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Metric</a> with the name(s) of the labs that you have requested from a client. In this instance, we recommend creating each lab value as its own custom metric. At this time, it is not possible for lab results received from these PDF reports to be automatically added to a Metric Graph, and we will update this post if that becomes available.\u{a0}</p><p>There are future updates planned to enhance this workflow, enabling you to add a lab directly to a client&#39;s chart.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section12\"></p><h2>Do you offer specialty or functional medicine labs?\u{a0}</h2><p>Currently, we offer 400+ lab orders through Quest Diagnostics.\u{a0}</p><p>Healthie offers a separate integration with Evexia for ordering LabCorp and some speciality labs.

A new client package can be created, and any number of labs can be added to the package for clients to purchase &amp; have tested (by visiting a Quest draw site). This enables providers to create tailored lab packages/panels.\u{a0}</p><p>At this time, custom lab orders cannot be placed through Healthie/Quest Diagnostics.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section14\"></p><h2>Can I turn off notifications for E-Labs</h2><p>Within Healthie, you&#39;ll receive a notification within Healthie, and via email, when a new lab order requisition has been received. These notifications cannot be disabled at this time.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><p id=\"Section15\"></p><h2>If I add a lab to a recurring package, will the order recur?\u{a0}</h2><p>No. The lab order will process only one time, creating a lab requisition order &amp; prompting your client to schedule their appointment at a local Quest lab. If you would like to retest your client (ie. every 3 months) for the same lab, you will need to charge them again for a package containing this order.

This is done through our integration with Stripe that connects your business bank account to your Healthie account. Our direct integration with Stripe eliminates the need for any 3rd party logins or payment processors -- you&#39;ll be able to accept payments and charge for services right from your Healthie account.\u{a0}</p><p>HSA/FSA cards can be treated just like credit cards.

In this case, clients will use their HSA to pay towards their deductible (out-of-pocket payment required before insurance starts covering \u{a0}healthcare expenses). On top of this, a client may add additional dollars to their HSA for more planned healthcare spending, to save on post-tax expenses.</li></ul></blockquote><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Reasons for Declined HSA/FSA Transactions</h2><p>There are several reasons why your client&#39;s HSA/FSA cards are declined, including:</p><ul><li>Insufficient funds</li><li>Funds have expired or do not roll over</li><li>Card has not been activated / set up by the client for utilization</li><li>Some HSA/FSA cards only cover limited types of medical care, and your service, based on your unique medical merchant code, is not covered by the card provider.\u{a0}</li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Troubleshooting Declined HSA/FSA Transactions</h2><p>Here are some additional steps you can take when receiving a declined HSA/FSA transaction:</p><ul><li>We recommend reaching out to your client, to ensure that their card has been activated and has funds that are eligible to be utilized.\u{a0}</li><li>If your client&#39;s HSA/FSA has been declined, you may want to send them an <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/372-invoices\">invoice through Healthie</a>.

By default, Healthie attempts to set an MCC of 8099 for all provider accounts. However, the code designation is reviewed by Stripe.\u{a0}HSA/FSA cards are heavily regulated and Stripe can only legally assign a medical code of 8099 to licensed healthcare providers.\u{a0}</p><p>Life coaching (nutrition, weight loss, etc) service is typically not an HSA qualified expense, so Stripe is not able to configure this account to accept these cards.</p><p>Services covered by HSA/FSA can vary, but for a quick overview of what types of purchases are covered, you can review\u{a0}this link: <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf\">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf</a>.\u{a0}</p><p>If you are experiencing issues with HSA/FSA transactions, and want to confirm your Stripe Merchant Code, please email hello@gethealthie.com.\u{a0}Healthie can work with Stripe to adjust the MCC for your account, if your business meets the qualifications set forth by the IRS.\u{a0}Healthie will need a valid business website in order to adjust/update your MCC. </p>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "5bd7a8c104286356f0a533b8", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:28.289841Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:28.289842Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("620d5e2fd86136157d9a5173") }

Here are some troubleshooting steps:&nbsp;</p><ul data-children-count=\"0\">\n\t\n<li><strong>Make sure your camera is connected and turned on.</strong> If you use an external webcam for Zoom, check the connecting cable for damage, and try connecting it to a different USB port if possible. For wireless webcams, check your Bluetooth settings and make sure the device's battery is charged.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Make sure your camera is selected in Zoom. </strong>During a meeting, select the up arrow next to the camera icon and make sure the desired webcam is chosen.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Close other programs that can access your camera. </strong>Other software could be competing with Zoom for your webcam.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Check your device settings.</strong> Go to the camera settings on your device to make sure it's not disabled.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Check your app permissions. </strong>Make sure Zoom has permission to use your camera by going to your device's app settings.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Update your device's drivers. </strong>Windows users should go into the Device Manager and check to make sure the camera's drivers are up-to-date.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Update your Mac.</strong> If you're on a Mac running macOS 10.7, upgrade to a newer version of the macOS operating system.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Error Message: Address is invalid listed. </strong>Most commonly this means that the client did not download the Zoom app to their device. While they do not need to have their own personal Zoom account, or log in, they do need to have the app downloaded so the application can launch.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Change Zoom's Advanced Video Settings. </strong>Zoom provides advanced tools designed to enhance video playback, but they sometimes have the opposite result. If your video continues to be distorted, open Zoom while not in a meeting and select the Settings gear, then choose the Video tab and select Advanced to adjust these options.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Restart your device. </strong>A reboot fixes most computer problems because it closes any ongoing processes that could be interfering with software or hardware, such as your camera.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Check your internet speed. </strong>A bad internet connection&nbsp;can affect your audio and video quality on Zoom. We recommend using a wired or WiFi connection rather than a cellular connection for the best quality. Ideally, your internet speed would be around 50mbps or higher to support Zoom. You can learn more about your internet speed by <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/\">running a speed test</a> or contacting your internet provider.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Be sure you're logged in using your provider email. </strong>If you have a personal Zoom account, be sure you are logged out of that account on your Zoom web browser.&nbsp; If you are logged into a personal account, when you click on your Zoom link, you will see the option to \"Join as Attendee.\" You will need to log out of this Zoom account (see image below), and then log back into Healthie and re-join the meeting using the link.</li>\t\n<li><strong>Be sure both you and your client are using the correct Zoom link. </strong>In the case that you have recurring Zoom appointments with clients, be sure that both you and your clients are using the latest version of the Zoom link within Healthie, to avoid any trouble joining the appointment at its set time.&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li><strong>Check your internet speed:&nbsp;</strong>Go to <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/\">https://www.speedtest.net/</a> and click the \"Go\" button. At the end of the testing process, you should see two numbers indicating your internet speed at the top, e.g. Download mbps 70; Upload mbps 10.

The core tenant of a program is that it drips content out over the course of weeks and months, rather than sharing all information at once. Content in a program can include videos, e-mails, documents, surveys and quizzes, and links to external websites.</p><p>Programs can be used as lead generation tools (and given to clients for free), as a part of an encompassing online program, or as an add-on service that clients can purchase directly from you (and, via Healthie). Clients appreciate receiving guidance over time, in digestible formats that enable them to build successful habits or achieve specific goals. Wellness programs can also be used to deliver branded programs, like the Diabetes Prevention Program.</p><br><p><strong>Utilize the Healthie Programs feature to:\u{a0}</strong></p><ul><li>Distribute\u{a0}videos, e-mails, documents, surveys over a cadence of time</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/144-creating-an-education-course\">Assign specific modules to specific courses</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/406-fixed-date-and-rolling-enrollment\">Set a start date or enable ongoing enrollment</a>\u{a0}for a particular program</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/444-tracking-client-progress-in-a-program\">Track your clients&#39; progress</a>\u{a0}as they complete a program</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/373-deep-dive-programs-report\">Run a Program&#39;s Report</a>\u{a0}to gain valuable insights into your program&#39;s performance\u{a0}</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/138-having-clients-purchase-an-education-course\">Tie Programs to Packages</a>\u{a0}to sell as an add-on service you provide</li></ul><p>Learn how to create your first program <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/144-creating-an-education-course\">here</a>. </p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2 id=\"Building-an-Online-Program-yYRl6\">Building an Online Program</h2><p>Here are some resources to help you begin building and running your online program.\u{a0}</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/144-creating-an-education-course\">Creating a program</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/145-adding-clients-to-a-course\">Adding clients to a program</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/329-emedding-a-video-into-a-program\">Adding a video to your program</a></li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/138-having-clients-purchase-an-education-course\">Tie your program into a package</a></li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2 id=\"Track-Program-and-Client-Progress-vsTDt\">Track Program and Client Progress</h2><p>Launching a program allows you to help educate, and work with, several clients at once.

Here are some common ways Healthie providers use Programs, that may be applicable for your business.\u{a0}</p><p><strong>1. Run a 12-week online group on a particular topic</strong></p><p>e.g., a weight loss program: Every Tuesday at 7 pm, for 12 weeks, participants log onto Healthie in a group video chat (via Zoom) and a provider will walk through a topic of interest (e.g., Mindful Eating). Following this live session, participants receive relevant handouts and a short quiz. At the culmination of a program, all participants receive a survey to rate their satisfaction. This data can then be aggregated\u{a0}</p><p><strong>2. Distribute content as part of a corporate wellness offering</strong></p><p>Employees of a corporate wellness environment receive weekly videos on a particular topic, as well as a handout and short quiz. Once a month, employees participate in a group lunch and learn (virtual or in-person). Throughout the duration of a program, employees have access to Healthie&#39;s client logging and messaging platform to build accountability and relationships with a Healthie provider. At the end of a program, data and outcomes can be aggregated to evaluate efficacy.</p><p><strong>3. Provide reference material</strong></p><p>Whether it&#39;s content for a corporate wellness program, or a nutrition guide for a single client, the education tool is an excellent way to provide reference material.\u{a0}</p><p>You don’t have to worry about your clients forgetting or misremembering your guidance. Your clients don’t have to worry about losing printed material.\u{a0}</p><p>The scalability of this tool makes it an ideal way to distribute these kinds of materials to groups of all sizes.</p><p><strong>4. Create bonus material for packages</strong></p><p>Bonus materials are a highly effective way of adding value to your packages and setting yourself apart from the competition.\u{a0}</p><p>This strategy makes your practice more marketable and enhances the level of care you provide. Having valuable material will boost client satisfaction and retention.\u{a0}</p><p><strong>5. Create an online course for sale\u{a0}</strong></p><p>Creating multiple revenue streams is an excellent way to stabilize your practice, especially if it’s still new.\u{a0}</p><p>Selling a course through\u{a0}<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/190-building-client-packages-to-charge-for-sessions\">Client Packages</a>\u{a0}is an excellent source of passive income and a way for you to provide care to as many people as possible.\u{a0}</p><p><strong>6. Distribute feedback surveys\u{a0}</strong></p><p>Feedback surveys are a great way to continually improve your practice and care.\u{a0}</p><p>The information you receive will give you ideas for new services, ways you can improve, and insights into how your clients think.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2 id=\"Program-FAQs-M5DNw\">Program FAQs</h2><p><strong>Can I set a cap on program participants?\u{a0}</strong></p><p>While you cannot set a cap on program participants, if your program is part of a package that includes group appointments, you may set a cap on the number of participants that can sign up for the group appointment.\u{a0}</p><p><b>Can I change the order of programs on the Programs Page? </b></p><p>Enterprise customers can reach out to <a href=\"mailto:hello@gethealthie.com\">hello@gethealthie.com</a> for assistance in customizing program order. </p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2 id=\"Additional-Resources-1gGhd\">Additional Resources</h2><p>See how a real-life Healthie customer, Kelly&#39;s Choice, has taken their educational content and created a library of Programs.

And weights tend to fluctuate due to fluid shifts, but a consistent trend down in percent body can be a reliable indicator of progress.</li><li><b>Waist Circumference</b> - tracking waist circumference over time can motivate clients towards a healthier weight, and reduced <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/guidelines/current/obesity-guidelines/e_textbook/txgd/4142.htm\">risk for disease</a> in the future. Nutrition professionals commonly measure and track waist circumference along with weight and body fat percentages to show clients a snapshot of their current physical status.\u{a0} \u{a0}</li><li><strong>Caloric Requirements</strong> -\u{a0}The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is a widely used tool to determine an individual’s <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate.html\">basal metabolic rate</a> (BMR) and daily <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Kilocalorie.html\">kilocalorie</a> requirements. The estimated BMR value is multiplied by a number that corresponds to the individual’s activity level.

The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation may be used to assist weight loss — by reducing the kilocalorie intake numbers below the estimated maintenance intake of the equation.</li><li><strong>BMI Graph </strong>- based on provider-logged height and weights, Body Mass Index (BMI) automatically is calculated and trended on a graph which each new weight entry. BMI is typically required when submitting CMS1500 claims to insurance companies. Choose to make BMI visible, or hidden from clients, depending on your counseling approach and client-goals (see below: &quot;Hiding metrics from client view&quot;).

Growth charts will automatically plot and trend with each new height or weight metric entry. Pediatric dietitians, pediatric nutritionists, and lactation consultants commonly track growth.

Additionally, it's essential for coordination and logistics.

Additionally, chat is connected to the rest of a client's profile within the Healthie platform.&nbsp;</p><hr><p id=\"Section6\"></p><h2>6.

The approach you take depends on your goals for the session, and how much client information you&#39;d like to capture.\u{a0}</p><h3>Option 1: Manually enroll participants\u{a0}</h3><p>You can add individual clients, groups of clients, or other team members by locating the webinar on your calendar &gt; Edit &gt; searching for your contacts.\u{a0}</p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/60779924e0324b5fdfd0b17b/file-L6DkSGnLZX.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; \" /></p><h3><strong>Option 2: Share your video link directly with contacts</strong></h3><p>If you&#39;d like to share the Zoom link directly, and not capture any client information, or have a Healthie account created for participants, then you can share the direct &quot;Client Link&quot; from the webinar details.\u{a0}</p><p><img  src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/607799608996210f18bd37dc/file-PyJHigS40X.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; \" /></p><h3>Option 3: Share your calendar link with contacts\u{a0}</h3><p>Alternatively, you can <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/427-use-healthies-calendar-widget-as-a-url\" target=\"_blank\">share your calendar URL</a> with existing or prospective clients. Your calendar link can be shared on your website, social media pages, in emails, and other marketing assets. When clients click your calendar link, they&#39;ll located your webinar appointment type.

To make a <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/134-creating-a-free-consultation-as-an-appointment\" target=\"_blank\">webinar package free</a>, simply indicate &quot;0&quot; in the pricing details.

Webinar Group) -- review the setting options for your package to determine how you&#39;d like new and/or existing clients to be handled\u{a0}</li><li>Under &quot;Included Items&quot; &gt; Appointments &gt; Locate your appointment type (ie. Healthy Eating Webinar) and indicate how many sessions you&#39;d like to give your client credits for. If your webinar is part of a recurring series for example, then you would want to adjust the &quot;included sessions&quot; accordingly.\u{a0}</li><li>Ensure that the setting &quot;Require appointment booking during package purchase is selected and that the Appointment type is bookable&gt; this will prompt clients to actively enroll into the webinar date/time on your calendar while.

For context, if you have an Organization admin or an API user scheduling on behalf of a provider at your Organization, they can only schedule 100 meetings that day. Those meetings can be spread throughout the following days/weeks, but if they are all scheduled on the same day, the admin or API user will hit that limit and Zoom won’t generate a link.

Modules are released and accessible to your clients starting from the set start date. All clients enrolled in a fixed-date program will receive their modules at the same date/time according to your module release schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t Programs that start and end on a specific date are considered a fixed-start program. These types of programs allow a group of clients to begin the same program at the same time and move through the modules collectively. You may choose to have clients engage with each other (ie. create a group chat, or offer weekly group sessions) &mdash; but this is optional.</p><p>\n\t For a fixed start program, when you select a start date and time, the time you select will be when the program emails or modules are released each day.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t <strong>Benefit</strong>: Many wellness providers choose this type of structure when running short-term programs that are meant to be engaging and drive new business. These types of programs can be run periodically throughout the year, or even one-time, depending on your business goals.&nbsp;For example, a New Year Wellness Challenge can run every January or 30-day Sugar Detox program can run once every season.</p><p>\n\t <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/5e98e80d04286364bc988191/file-16xJnnvsaE.png\"></p><p>\n\t <strong style=\"background-color: initial;\">Allow late enrollment:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>\n\t If a client is enrolled past the start date, they will automatically receive all previously released content. This allows them to immediately&nbsp;catch up with the rest of the enrolled members in regards to accessible content.&nbsp;</p><hr><p id=\"Section2\"></p><h2> Rolling Start Programs&nbsp;</h2><p>\n\t Rolling Start programs are available for clients to join at any time, and there is no fixed start date. A client can purchase a rolling enrollment program and run through it on their own schedule, based on the module release schedule that you establish for the programs.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t A wellness program for individual clients to enroll in on a rolling basis is considered an&nbsp; <em>evergreen&nbsp;</em>program, that you want to continue to offer over time. It doesn’t matter when a new client joins. As they are added to your program, they independently receive the program content on the timeline you selected.</p><p>\n\t For a rolling start program start program, you can individually edit the times when program emails and modules are released each day. To do so, navigate to the program you want to edit. Click on \"Edit\" and navigate to the \"Clients\" tab within the program. You can see a list of clients, and click on the pencil icon to edit the release time for each client.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/60ec595961c60c534bd6e8fc/file-0CMA5Swwej.png\"></p><p>\n\t <strong>Benefit:</strong> Evergreen programs offer a way to continue to gain revenue all year round. You can work on building up a few, solid wellness programs, that really enhance your ideal clients’ experience when working with you (ie. you work with eating disorder clients and you offer a comprehensive “Intuitive Eating Program”). You’ll have to continue to market you program, but it helps with client retention and success.</p><p>\n\t <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bbe96a22c7d3a04dd5b8761/images/5e31b8562c7d3a7e9ae6ee63/file-fnTM0WSOId.png\"></p><hr><p id=\"Section3\"></p><h2> <strong>Best practices for program enrollment&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>\n\t<strong>Fixed start</strong> programs are typically used when you want a cohort or group of clients to all begin at the same time.&nbsp;</p><ul>\n\t\n<li>a weight loss challenge</li>\t\n<li>tied to a scheduled series of webinars you are hosting</li>\t\n<li>corporate wellness program that begins and end in a business quarter&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li>a limited program you are offering&nbsp;</li></ul><p>\n\t <strong>Rolling start </strong>programs are best used for:</p><ul>\n\t\n<li>a program that does not require provider guidance or engagement</li>\t\n<li>content being sold for passive income for your practice</li>\t\n<li>content that is meant to enhance whatever packages you are selling&nbsp;</li>\t\n<li>meal plans, health tips etc.</li></ul><hr><p id=\"Section4\"></p><h2> Additional Resources</h2><p>\n\t Read more about Healthie's Programs, as well as the benefits of running a wellness program <a href=\"https://www.gethealthie.com/blog/wellness-programs-workplace\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t We also recommend that you join our Deep Dive Programs Webinar to learn more on how to create a program and how to advertise your program to&nbsp;your clients -- sign-up: <a href=\"http://calendly.com/healthie-success\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Dive Program Webinar</a></p>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "5bbe9720042863158cc749fc", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:41.085189Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:41.085190Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("5da68a6904286364bc9073fc") }

Complete Marketing Assets</strong></p><p>In tandem with completing your integration, we will work with your marketing team to collect appropriate assets to complete your marketplace profile for <a href=\"http://harbor.gethealthie.com\" target=\"_blank\">harbor.gethealthie.com</a> and your help documentation for Healthie customers. Note that these pages are updated by you and any changes made to the integration may require updates to your documentation. For the first 8 weeks in our marketplace, your profile will have a &quot;Pilot&quot; indicator to let customers know that this integration is new to Healthie&#39;s marketplace.</p><br><div class=\"callout-green\"><p>Our philosophy at Healthie is to ensure our customers pick the partners best for them. Therefore, we don&#39;t push one partner over another. We want to be sure our customers know the categories of partners we have available and encourage them to speak with your team, so they&#39;re speaking with the experts on your solution. The same goes for success and support. While we can support basic questions about the experience, we&#39;re not experts in how your platform should work, so be prepared to answer additional questions from mutual customers about the integration.</p></div><hr role=\"separator\"><h3>Join our Marketplace: For Consulting Partners</h3><p>Healthie works with consulting agencies across various specialties, from dev agencies, to credentialing agencies, and coaching programs.

This article reviews the available solutions, so that your team may select the integrations that works best for your business needs &amp; workflows.</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>RCM Options</h2><p>Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) platforms provide full-service claims management to customers. These API-first platforms use rich data sources and automations to detect, prevent, and fix claim issues. RCMs typically submit claims, follow up with insurance companies, and appeal denied claims 24 hours a day - significantly decreasing the need for administrative work.</p><p>Think of an RCM as a way to generally outsource your biller or admin needs for insurance billing (although likely resources will still be needed to collect client owed responsibilities for any portion of the claim that was not covered by insurance).</p><br><p>Healthie offers integrations with the following RCMs: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/1012-candid-health-and-healthie\">Candid Health</a></li><li>More RCM options are available Healthie’s API, learn more <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/943-healthies-api\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Clearinghouse Options</h2><p>A claims clearinghouse acts as an intermediary between the organization and third-party insurance payers. Instead of submitting claims to each payer’s portal, a Clearinghouse allows the provider or organization to send all claims to the Clearinghouse - and the Clearinghouse submits to the payer (after scrubbing it for errors like missing fields). The claims reimbursement details then pulls back into the Clearinghouse from the payer.</p><p>Think of a Clearinghouse as your one central hub to send &amp; manage all claims. It won’t replace the need for a biller per-se. A clearinghouse will not automatically correct and resubmit claims for you, this will still need to be managed by a biller or admin staff.</p><br><p>Healthie offers integrations with the following Clearinghouses: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/1163-change-healthcare-claims-management\" target=\"_blank\">Change Healthcare Claims</a> (currently in development)</li><li><a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/176-submitting-a-claim-through-office-ally-from-healthie\">Office Ally</a></li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>All RCMs use Clearinghouses, but not all Clearinghouses are RCMs</h2><ul><li>Candid Health uses Change Healthcare as their clearinghouse. They will directly manage the enrollment process for their customer, bypassing the need to self-enroll with Change. </li><li>If you are already set up with Change directly, but want to use Candid as an RCM, the Candid team can work with you to get your permissions transferred over to Candid.</li></ul><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Insurance Billing Automations</h2><p>There are several planned releases for insurance billing that will help to automate the claims creation and submission processes. Billing automations can also connect to integrations that a your may be using within Healthie (ie. an RCM or Clearinghouse). </p><p>Learn more about upcoming <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/1096-insurance-billing-automations\">Insurance Billing Automations</a> planned for Healthie. </p>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "63ac6cace04b5a4ad41d45b8", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:50.609027Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:50.609028Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("645157db7fbafd6b38243e2b") }

Healthcare providers can access patient health information recorded by other providers electronically using NC HealthConnex, including records, labs, diagnostics, medical history, allergies, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n\t If you are required to connect, please review the information below, including next steps to notify Healthie.&nbsp;</p><hr><h2>What is the Deadline to Connect?&nbsp;</h2><p>\n\t The extension of the connection deadline until January 1, 2023, allows additional time for health care providers to complete their technical onboarding process without being out of compliance with the HIE Act. However, please note that there are more than 5,000 facilities in onboarding at this time. Providers should continue to work diligently to connect to NC HealthConnex. Signing a participation agreement and actively engaging in the onboarding process with your technical vendor demonstrates a good-faith effort to meet the extended deadline of January 1, 2023.</p><p>\n\t More information: <a href=\"https://hiea.nc.gov/faqs/connection-deadline-faqs#when-should-i-plan-to-connect-to-nc-healthconnex-now-that-the-deadline-has-been-extended\">Connect Deadline FAQs</a></p><hr><h2>How do I connect with the NC HealthConnex?</h2><p>\n\t The first step is to complete the <a href=\"https://hiea.nc.gov/providers/how-connect/nc-healthconnex-participation-agreement#participation-agreement-types\">NC HIEA Participation Agreement</a>.

These concepts sound similar but end up being used in distinct ways to accomplish different objectives.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Appointment Locations</h2><p>Appointment Locations are specific (normally physical) locations where a specific appointment with an “In-Person” contact type will be conducted. These Appointment Locations are configured under settings -&gt; appointment locations. Learn more about <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/461-rooms\" target=\"_blank\">adjusting appointment locations</a>. An Appointment Location can be a full address (e.g 1407 Broadway, New York, New York, 10019) but do not have to be (e.g “Office A” or “Fresno Campus”).</p><p>Appointment locations are tied to a specific appointment when the appointment is booked, and are not tied directly to an appointment type or provider. However, you can limit which locations a provider can be scheduled for on a given day via our “<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/424-using-availability-by-appointment-type\" target=\"_blank\">Availability by Location</a>” setting.\u{a0}This setting is commonly used if your providers travel to different locations (e.g they will be at the “Fresno Campus” on Tuesdays and Thursdays and “Palo Alto Campus” on Mondays and Wednesdays).</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>State Licensure Information</h2><p>State Licenses allow you to track which providers are licensed to practice in which U.S state (e.g Provider “Jane Doe” is licensed in “NY’, “MA”, and “CA”). This state license feature can be relevant no matter the contact type of the appointment, and is commonly used by companies delivering virtual car in multiple states. It can be used to ensure that patients are not scheduling with providers who are not legally able to provide care to the patient.\u{a0}</p><p>State licenses are configured via the API (via the `updateOrganizationMember` mutation) or by data load. The convenience feature to allow configuration of them directly in the Healthie UI is being made available in mid-August. Once you have configured professional state licenses for your providers, and listed which appointment types require a state-licensed provider, then our Availability Algorithm will take the state licenses into account when generating potential availability.\u{a0}</p><p>1) For professional state licensure and <a href=\"https://gethealthie.launchnotes.io/board/provider-tags-back-end\" target=\"_blank\">tags for team members</a>, those are both currently done via the API. It is the `updateOrganizationMember` and `createTag` mutations respectively.</p><p>Professional state licenses and appointment locations can be used in conjunction with each other, and are not exclusive. Many Healthie users will not need the professional state license or appointment location functionality, while others will utilize these features as key pieces of their Healthie set-up. Here are some common things to look for to know if these features are relevant, and which one you should be using when.\u{a0}</p><hr role=\"separator\"><h2>Utilizing Appointment &amp; Professional State Licenses</h2><p>You should consider using <strong><u>appointment locations</u></strong> if:\u{a0}</p><ul><li>You provide (at least some) in-person care</li></ul><p>You should consider using<strong><u>\u{a0}state licenses</u></strong> if:\u{a0}</p><ul><li>Your business provides virtual-first care in multiple states</li><li>The type of care requires that a healthcare provider be licensed in the specific state</li><li>You want to include these restrictions in patient self-scheduling, so that they are automatically enforced</li></ul><h4>Learn more about Professional State Licenses <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/1005-appointment-settings-state-licensure-booking-requirements\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</h4>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "61688b6312c07c18afddd73d", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:56.706981Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:56.706982Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("62f24cca6d67192dc61b917a") }

Within that spectrum, there are three most common options. </p><br><p><b>1) Application-level separation (DEFAULT)</b></p><br><p>Prerequisites: None. This is the default.</p><br><p>Healthie&#39;s infrastructure utilizes multi-tenant databases and customer data is separated at the application level. \u{a0}Strict privacy controls are present in our application that are designed to ensure data privacy and to prevent one customer from accessing another customer’s data (i.e., logical separation). These controls are verified by automated and manual testing, as well as via regularly conducted 3rd party penetration tests. </p><br><p>Since users on this isolation strategy are logging in from the same domain name/mobile application (The default <a href=\"http://secure.gethealthie.com\">secure.gethealthie.com </a>and Healthie mobile apps), it is possible for a patient or clinician to be working with multiple organizations. When this happens, users see the ability to switch between their different Healthie accounts. We have more info here - <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/471-clients-having-multiple-accounts-with-healthie-providers\">https://help.gethealthie.com/article/471-clients-having-multiple-accounts-with-healthie-providers</a> </p><br><p><b>2) Authentication Namespace Separation</b></p><br><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: A full or semi whitelabel. Non-whitelabeled domains or apps can no longer be used. Some API arguments need to be adjusted.</p><br><p>With authentication namespace separation, an organization&#39;s authentication layer is placed into its own namespace based on the whitelabel domain and mobile app the customer has set up. Underlying data is still stored in a multi-tenant database, but log-in information is scoped just to the customer. This means that users will have separate log-in information for each organization, and will not see the &quot;Switch Account&quot; screen mentioned at <a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/471-clients-having-multiple-accounts-with-healthie-providers\">https://help.gethealthie.com/article/471-clients-having-multiple-accounts-with-healthie-providers</a>.</p><br><p><b>Note</b>: If you’re on your own\u{a0}Namespace and on full whitelabel, you need your own Google OAuth in order to make use of our\u{a0}<a href=\"https://help.gethealthie.com/article/146-sync-healthie-with-ical-google-and-outlook-calendars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calendar sync</a>. Additionally, you cannot Namespace a staging environment. </p><br><p><b>3) Full Database Separation </b></p><br><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: A full or semi whitelabel AND a minimum overall contract size. Non-whitelabeled domains or apps can no longer be used. A new header needs to be added to all API arguments.</p><br><p>For customers with very stringent data isolation requirements, Healthie can set up the customer in a new, single-tenant Postgres instance. All application-level separation protections still remain as well, so customers can have multiple separate organizations within the single-tenant database (additional seat costs can apply for the additional organizations). </p><br><p>If you have questions, or requirements not covered in the above options, please reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@gethealthie.com\">hello@gethealthie.com</a></p>"), markdown_content: None, version: 0, last_edited_by: None, helpscout_collection_id: "61688b6312c07c18afddd73d", created_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:57.795100Z, updated_at: 2024-09-10T10:13:57.795101Z, helpscout_article_id: Some("64b6900bac752e2a94767e00") }
